This folder contains the ssh keys for use in encrypting sensitive files. Each user should create a folder with their preferred
username containing a public ssh key in a single file.
For simplicity of use, we assume that the encryption scheme used for now is RSA.

## Current usage

The public-keys in this repository is currently used to do the following:
* Automatically create users on the servers using name of public key folder. The key is copied to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, to grant access to the server. Currently accessible servers are listed as [resources](#computing-resources)
* Certification on XAL nebula sub-network. Instructions for setting up nebula can be found [here](#nebula)

All users with keys on `internal/master` have access to the above functionality.

## Example
A user creates a folder `/internal/pub_keys/roberts/` containing a file `id_rsa.pub` which contains the public rsa keystring. 
When the PR is approved and merged, you can then ssh to dev.xal.no with your username from any machine using your corresponding private key. In the above example we would type `ssh roberts@dev.xal.no`.


## Nebula 
This repository contains a default configuration file to connect to the XAL https://github.com/slackhq/nebula subnetwork. 
You should install nebula  at this point. Installing nebula can be done either by downloading their pre-built binaries or compiling from source. 

Upon arriving at `dev.xal.no` you can retrieve the certification needed to set up nebula. The certificates and keys needed to connect to nebula are located in the folder `dev.xal.no:/home/sally`, in a tarball named `USER_nebula_cert.tar.gz.age`.

Using https://github.com/FiloSottile/age this tarball can be decrypted with your private ssh key. For details see: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#ssh-keys 

Three files are contained in a folder extracted from the tarball. These three should be moved together with the `config.yml` file from this repository to `/etc/nebula/`. In the config file edit these lines:

```
pki:
  # The CAs that are accepted by this node. Must contain one or more certificates created by 'nebula-cert ca'
  ca: /etc/nebula/ca.crt
  cert: /etc/nebula/YOURNAME.laptop.crt
  key: /etc/nebula/YOURNAME.laptop.key
```
to point to your newly aquired certification files. 

Launching nebula with `nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml` now allows you to ssh directly to our compute-node `sally` at `$USER@192.168.100.200`.
