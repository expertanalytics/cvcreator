## Description 

This folder contains the ssh keys for use in encrypting sensitive files. Each user should create a folder with their preferred
username containing a public ssh key in a single file.
For simplicity of use, we assume that the encryption scheme used for now is RSA.

## Example
A user creates a folder `/internal/pub_keys/roberts/` containing a file `id_rsa.pub` which contains the public rsa keystring.
