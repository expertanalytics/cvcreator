Chaospy -- Python library for doing Uncertainty Qualification
-------------------------------------------------------------

Chaospy is a numerical tool for performing uncertainty quantification using
polynomial chaos expansions and advanced Monte Carlo methods.
It includes lots of probability theory, variance reduction techniques,
approximations, and Gaussian quadrature.

Numpoly -- Polynomials represented as numpy data types
------------------------------------------------------

Numpoly is a generic library for creating and manipulating polynomial arrays.

``numpoly`` is a subclass of ``numpy.ndarray`` and as such is compatible with
most ``numpy`` functions, where that makes sense.

lv2-plugins -- Realtime audio processing plugins for music production
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The lv2 plugin project is about writing audio processing plugins for music
production. The plugin in type is `lv2` which can be used on `Linux` and `Mac`.
The code is written in C.
So far we have implemented one simple delay alogrithm.
There are many more effect and plugin types one can implement.
Next steps include: equalizing, high and low pass filtering.

An interesting boundary condition is that all algorithms should be realtime 
capable.

Some members in the project plan to also build the physical representation of 
the implemented plugin into a guitar pedal. So we can compare the digital vs.
analog signal processing world.
