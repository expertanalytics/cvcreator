# A short summary of a live demo of taskwarrior

## Taskwarrior is ...

 - Add and complete tasks
 - Group tasks into projects
 - Add tags to tasks
 - Annotate tasks
 - Add dependencies between tasks
 - Add due dates, recurring tasks and much more

Taskwarrior uses all the above to sort task by priority. With some tweaking, the tasks
report can match your own preferences.

## Workflow

Similar to TODOs in code, Taskwarrior enables you to quickly jot down a task and go back
to the task at hand. For me, the main benefits are that I can quickly start work in the
morning, easily go back to old projects and have a feeling of accomplishment. When
entering tasks, write them short and concise so you immediately know what they are about.
