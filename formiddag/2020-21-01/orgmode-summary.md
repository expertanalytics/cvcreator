# A short summary of the live demo of org.mode
Org-mode is a package for emacs designed for handling tasks, projects planning, meeting minutes &c.
The talking points were
- Basic org.mode ingredients, like lists, checklists, tables and executable code snippets.
- What a task looks like
- How to tag tasks, add 'scheduled' and 'deadline'.
- How to search among your tasks, and present your work-week based on what tasks are scheduled.
- How to create a task template, and use org-capture to create tasks on the fly that are automatically placed in the right place.
- Finally a presentation of my own workflow, which uses most of the above talking points.
