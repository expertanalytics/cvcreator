      anti money laundering risk assessment of customers and creating interfaces for handling payment requests.
      I have experience working with cloud-based applications, managing data in databases,
      writing effective and transactional SQL queries, performing numerical simulations,
      in addition to both creating and integrating with APIs.

SelectedSkills:
    Communication: >
      Working in teams of people with different cultural and professional backgrounds have taught me to adapt my message
      to the listeners and to express my self precisely. I do also have teaching experience which I believe is a good attribute in a team-based working environment.
    Programming: >
      I do my best to deliver well tested and documented code that is easy to read and maintain.
    Databases: >
      I have worked extensively with databases and have a good understanding of the relational model.
      I do also have experience working with NoSQL databases.
    Event sourcing: >
      The last year I have been deeply involved in developing and implementing an event-sourcing system written in Golang and SQL.
      From this I have learned important key concepts and best practices (as well as potential challenges) when managing data with event-sourcing.
    Mathematics: >
      With an academical background in mathematics I have a good foundation
      for quickly learning and understanding methods used in fields such as data science and modelling.

Projects:
  A1:
    Activity: 04/20-07/20 - Software developer, Simula/Smittestopp.
    Role: Developer.
    Staffing: 5 developers.
    Description: >
      I was contracted by Simula to assist in the development of the contact tracing app Smittestopp that was being
      created as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. My main responsibility was to maintain and develop the backend service.
      This included creating APIs for retrieval of user data, and setting up a system that enabled unit/integration
      tests to perform actual queries against dockerized replicas of the production database.
    Tools: Python, Tornado, Alembic, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker.
  A2:
    Activity: 04/18-12/19 - Software developer, Vipps.
    Role: Developer.
    Staffing: 2-5 developers.
    Description: >
      I was a part of a team with the primary responsibility of creating a risk management back-office application.
      The application is used to organize customer data, monitor transactions, and investigate suspected cases of fraud or money laundering
      in order to be compliant with financial regulations.
      Some of my main tasks included implementing an automatic anti money laundering risk categorization system,
      integrating third-party APIs for collecting customer data, and automating the on-boarding process of merchant customers.
      I was also involved in designing and writing core components of the application such as the database model.
      Most of Vipps' applications run in Kubernetes, and through this project I gained experience in using this system
      for deploying and managing applications.
    Tools: Golang, SQL, Azure, Kubernetes
  A3:
    Activity: 02/18-04/18 - Software developer, Auka.
    Role: Developer.
    Staffing: Two developers.
