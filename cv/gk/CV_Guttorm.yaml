Summary:
    I hold a Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering from the University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory, completed summer 2017.
    My academic background is focused around applied mathematics, programming, and numerical simulations. Since joining Expert Analytics I have been engaged
    in both the Fintech industry and a project concerning shift scheduling optimization. My main programming languages are Go and Python, and I enjoy getting
    involved in projects that requires me to explore new fields and technologies.
    \\\\
    I consider that the combination of possessing fundamental skills in mathematics and programming together with various practical work experiences has enabled
    me to contribute and solve problems in multidisciplinary projects.
