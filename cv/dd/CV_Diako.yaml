Summary: >
    I hold a MSc. in Theoretical Physics and I have submitted my Ph.D. in 
    Computational Fluid Mechanics. As a student at both Physics and Mathematics 
    institutes at the University of Oslo, I have acquired a broad knowledge in 
    various physical, mathematical and numerical methods, as well as data science.

    Within my Ph.D. period I have had the opportunity to work both alone and in 
    team with other researchers from both Norway and several other international 
    universities. In addition, I have had two international research stays 
    (six months in total) at the Kobe University, Japan. The core of my doctoral 
    research was related to the development of high performance numerical codes, 
    utilizing both low level (C/C++) and high level (Python/Cython) languages, 
    to study plasma-object interactions and ionospheric instabilities and 
    turbulence. An important part of my research has been the validation of 
    existing and new mathematical models of plasma-object interactions by means 
    of numerical simulations and comparison with experimental measurements.

SelectedSkills:
    "Communication": >
        As a result of my Ph.D. research in a multidisciplinary research 
        environment, and teaching duties at the University of Oslo, I have a lot 
        of training in writing and presenting complex methods and technical details
        to a wide spectrum of audiences with different backgrounds.     
    "Development": >
        I have been involved in developing both high performance codes and writing 
        scripts for data analysis and visualization for both large and small 
        projects. My Ph.D. research reflects my ability to work alone and in 
        teams with people with different background and education. 
    "Management": >
        Through my work with different projects and people I have gained experience 
        in how to design, develop and manage both small and large projects.  
    "Physics, Mathematics, and Programming": >
        With a broad background from different fields within Physics and Mathematics, 
        I have developed the necessary analytical skills and mindset for approaching 
        complex phenomena and problems. Developing new numerical codes, and generating 
        and analyzing large scale simulation data to validate existing and new 
        mathematical models have been a core component of my research.

        Description: >
            This was my final project as a Ph.D. student. During this project,
            I extended the Orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory, which describes 
            plasma-object interactions, to non-Maxwellian plasmas. To validate 
            the theory, I had to add a generic functionality to PUNC++ (described 
            below) for handling plasma particles with arbitrary velocity distribution 
            functions. A very good agreement between the theory and numerical 
            simulations with PUNC++ was achieved. 
        Tools: "C++, CMake, GCC, FEniCS, PUNC++, ParaView"

        Activity: "PUNC++ - Particle-in-Unstructured-Cell written in C++"
        Period: "July 2017 - October 2018"

        Description: >
            In order to be able to run large scale simulations of plasma-object 
            interactions, a high performance programming code is an absolute 
            necessity. For this reason C++ was chosen as the main programming 
            language for this project. PUNC++ is capable of simulating multiple 
            electrically conducting objects with arbitrary geometries, both 
            floating and connected to other objects in arbitrary circuits. 
            Several finite element solvers with different order of accuracy are 
            also implemented, which can be chosen by the user depending on the 
            desired computational accuracy and efficiency.    
        Tools: "C++, CMake, GCC, FEniCS"

        Activity: "PUNC - Particle-in-Unstructured-Cell"
        Period: "2016 (September-December)"
        Role: "Co-leader and co-developer of the project"

        Description: >
            The main goal of this project was a rapid prototyping of a new model 
            for handling conducting objects with complex geometries in plasmas 
            using the particle-in-cell method within the framework of FEniCS.  
        Tools: "Python, FEniCS"

        Description: >
             SpectralDNS is a high-performance pseudo-spectral Navier-Stokes DNS 
             solver developed by Mikael Mortensen. My contribution to this 
             project is the implementation of magnetohydrodynamics solvers to 
             study plasma instabilities and turbulence in the ionosphere.
