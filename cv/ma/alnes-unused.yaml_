Snippets:
    - Future A15 addition, work in progress:
            Based on experience from these partially overlapping projects
            we designed a framework with reusable components for scientific
            3D visualization libraries, called FIXME-INSERT-NAME, and
            (INSERT final story here, hopefully we'll get the other projects on board with our work).

        Description: >
            FEniCS is a highly scalable parallel high performance computing system,
            but with a serial overhead due to preprocessing stages
            employing symbolic computations and code generation.
            Motivated in particular by optimization applications using
            the dolfin-adjoint library which relies heavily on these
            symbolic capabilities of FEniCS, I profiled and optimized
            large parts of the Python code.
        Tools: "Python, cProfile"
