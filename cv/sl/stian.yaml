Summary: >
    I have a masters thesis from The University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, finished in 2016, the result of which was published in Oxford Bioinformatics. During my time as a student I got exposed to several programming languages, such as R, Python, Scheme, Java, and Javascript. In my work experience following that, I have been eager to improve my knowledge of functional programming in strict languages, such as Scala, F\# and Haskell, but the bulk of my work experience has been with Java and Python. I believe in letting the compiler and linter tools do as much work as possible, so that I as the developer have fewer options to shoot myself in the foot. I consider myself a pragmatic programmer with the ability to see the world from the users perspective, and can thus see their problems and create real solutions. I have experience being the link between a development team and the customer, having been a tech lead for a small development team in a previous job.

SelectedSkills:
    "Learning and teaching": >
        I am very passionate about learning, and sharing what I have learned. I have spoken at Javazone, at Tekna meetups, and have held many internal technical presentations where I have worked.
    "Documentation": >
        I am eager to properly document what I do, because I want to make the next developer's life as easy as possible.
    "Code quality": >
        I am a firm believer in getting as much help as possible from the compiler, from linters, and from static code analysis tools to write high quality code. I also believe that code should be written for humans to read.
