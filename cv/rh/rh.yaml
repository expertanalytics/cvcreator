Summary: >
    I am finishing a PhD in astrophysics at the University of Oslo. My field of research is numerical N-body simulations in cosmology. Through my research I have developed expertise in numerical modeling, statistical and visual analysis of big data sets, signal processing, pattern recognition, high- and low-level programming, and code optimization. I have learned many complex concepts in science and technology, and demonstrated my ability to understand and combine many areas of knowledge. I consider myself an analytical, adaptive, and open-minded person with the ability to work highly individually and quickly adapt to unforseen circumstances.

        Staffing: "Team of 3"
        Description: >
                Together with my supervisors (David Mota and Claudio Llinares), I extended the freely available cosmological N-body code RAMSES to simulate an additional disformal scalar degree of freedom. This introduces a highly non-linear hyperbolic differential equation for the scalar field, as well as complex equations for the extra forces on the N-body particles. RAMSES is written in FORTRAN, and is designed to run in parallel on supercomputing clusters. Hence, I paid special attention to memory usage, efficient MPI parallelism, and low level code optimization. The output data ranged from gigabytes to terabytes, and statistical analysis of the output was necessary to draw scientific conclusions. I wrote several auxillary tools for data and image analysis, as well as a 1-dimensional hyperbolic solver in spherical symmetry for more detailed study of the non-linear equation of motion of the scalar field.  
        Tools: "Physical modeling, statistical data analysis, image analysis, scientific writing, FORTRAN, Python"
    A2:
        Activity: "Development and use of student software: AST2000 Mission Control"
        Period: "2015 - 2017"
        Role: "Developer and tester"
        Staffing: "Team of 8"
        Description: >
            As part of my work as a group teacher in AST1100/AST2000, I had a leading role as developer of the Python backend that the students used for visualisation. The code procedurally generates a virtual solar system for each student, and during the course the student interacts with this code to launch a satellite from one planet, achieve orbit around another planet and land a landing module safely. After finishing development and writing the exercises and user manual, I had the main responsibility for updating the codebase when students reported bugs and inconsistencies.
        Tools: "Analytical modeling, procedural generation, user interfacing, pedagogical writing, Python, LaTeX"
