Summary: >
    I hold a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Oslo, where my field of research was large scale numerical $N$-body simulations. Through my research and work I have developed expertise in numerical modeling, statistical and visual analysis of big data sets, signal processing, pattern recognition, high- and low-level programming, and code optimization. I have learned many complex concepts in science and technology, and demonstrated my ability to understand and combine many areas of knowledge. I consider myself an analytical, adaptive, and open-minded person with the ability to work highly individually and quickly adapt to unforeseen circumstances. I am experienced with having a holistic overview of a project, while at the same time being able to focus on details.

        Staffing: "Team of 10"
        Description: >
            This Statkraft project is aimed at detecting and diagnosing changes in operation of hydro power generators through analysis of recorded audio. I had a key role in the installation of microphones, setup of edge compute equipment, and collection and organization of data. I contributed with several important ideas for the analysis, as well as development of several algorithms and frameworks used on the edge computing device in the power plant.
        Tools: "Python, Amazon Web Services, TimescaleDB, Docker, physical theory (acoustics), edge computing"
    A2:
        Activity: "Automation of physical systems based on weather forecast"
        Period: "2019 - 2020"
        Role: "Lead developer"
        Staffing: "Team of 4"
        Description: >
            A cloud based application for modelling and optimising an automated industrial control system. The application can be accessed from a compatible system through a RESTful API; the cloud application performs a calculation based on online weather data and physical models, and returns the calculated optimal parameters for the automated system. I developed most of the physical model, and implemented the cloud based application from scratch. I was also responsible for assessing and minimising security risks, developing a complete testing pipeline, as well as writing user documentation.
        Tools: "Python, Azure Web App, Azure SQL, physical modelling (meteorology, thermodynamics)"
    A3:
        Activity: "Cosmological simulations with scalar fields"
        Period: "2013 - 2019"
        Role: "Researcher"
        Staffing: "Team of 3"
        Description: >
            Together with my supervisors (David Mota and Claudio Llinares), I extended the freely available cosmological $N$-body code RAMSES to simulate an additional disformal scalar degree of freedom. This introduces a highly non-linear hyperbolic differential equation for the scalar field, as well as complex equations for the extra forces on the $N$-body particles. RAMSES is written in FORTRAN, and is designed to run in parallel on supercomputing clusters. Hence, I paid special attention to memory usage, efficient MPI parallelism, and low level code optimization. The output data ranged from gigabytes to terabytes, and statistical analysis of the output was necessary to draw scientific conclusions. I wrote several auxiliary tools for data and image analysis, as well as a 1-dimensional hyperbolic solver in spherical symmetry for more detailed study of the non-linear equation of motion of the scalar field.
        Tools: "Physical modeling, statistical data analysis, image analysis, scientific writing, FORTRAN, Python"
    A4:
        Activity: "Development and use of student software: AST2000 Mission Control"
        Period: "2015 - 2017"
        Role: "Developer and tester"
        Staffing: "Team of 8"
        Description: >
            As part of my work as a group teacher in AST1100/AST2000, I had a leading role as developer of the Python backend that the students used for visualisation. The code procedurally generates a virtual solar system for each student, and during the course the student interacts with this code to launch a satellite from one planet, achieve orbit around another planet and land a landing module safely. After finishing development and writing the exercises and user manual, I had the main responsibility for updating the codebase when students reported bugs and inconsistencies.
        Tools: "Analytical modeling, procedural generation, user interfacing, pedagogical writing, Python, LaTeX"
