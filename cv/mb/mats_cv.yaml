            As a postdoctoral researcher in biomathematics, I was part of a research team led by Prof.
            Nils Chr. Stenseth and Prof. Jan Martin Nordbotten, devoted to developing a 
            mathematical framework for eco-evolutionary modeling. In particular, to connect 
            evolutionary models at different scales in a unified mathematical framework. E.g., 
            one may consider a population as a system of interacting species, or, one may
            consider the population as distinct individuals without imposing the category of species 
            upon them. A multi-scale description of an eco-evolutionary system can therefore give new
            insight into phenomena such as speciation. My role in this project was two-fold: To
            extend the existing mathematical framework in a more mathematically rigorous direction,
            and to apply this framework to a real-world eco-evolutionary system using biological data.

        Description: >
            During my doctoral work I spent some time at the Leibniz Universit{\"a}t 
            Hannover, Germany, as a visiting researcher, where I collaborated with Prof. Thomas 
            Wick. The purpose of this collaboration was to work on numerical solution algorithms
            for fracture propagation in brittle materials, where the fracture surface is 
            represented by a phase-field variable. Our strategy was to decouple the mechanics 
            from the phase-field and solve each linearized subproblem separately, while iteratively
            updating coupling terms. Analysis of the proposed algorithm revealed bounds on the
            elastic strain and the thickness of the phase-field surface for which convergence is 
            guaranteed. Moreover, stabilizing parameters were introduced and tailored specifically 
            to each subproblem. The resulting algorithm is a stable and efficient solution 
            procedure for the notoriously difficult phase-field brittle fracture propagation
            problems, including conditions for guaranteed convergence.

        Description: >
            The main objectives of my doctoral research was to provide part of the mathematical 
            models and simulation technology required to assess large-scale deployment
            of thermo-mechanical subsurface energy storage in the context of
            intermittent renewable energy. The relevant physical processes for this application
            is the coupling of geomechenics, flow, and heat transfer within a porous material, i.e.,
            thermo-poroelasticity. Thus, together with my supervisors; Prof. Florin Radu, 
            Prof. Inga Berre, and Prof. Jan Martin Nordbotten, we focused on different aspects
            of thermo-poroelasticity, relevant for the previously mentioned application, and under the 
            technical umbrella of mathematical modeling and analysis. In particular, the research
            was separated into three parts; (1) modeling, (2) analysis, and (3) implementation.

        Title: "Monolithic and splitting solution schemes for fully coupled quasi-static 
        thermo-poroelasticity with nonlinear convective transport"
        Summary: >
            This paper concerns monolithic and splitting-based iterative procedures for the coupled
            nonlinear thermo-poroelasticity model problem. The thermo-poroelastic model problem we
            consider is formulated as a three-field system of PDEâ€™s, consisting of an energy balance
            equation, a mass balance equation and a momentum balance equation, where the primary
            variables are temperature, fluid pressure, and elastic displacement. Due to the
            presence of a nonlinear convective transport term in the energy balance equation,
            it is convenient to have access to both the pressure and temperature gradients.
            Hence, we introduce these as two additional variables and extend the original 
            three-field model to a five-field model. For the numerical solution of this 
            five-field formulation, we compare six approaches that differ by how we treat 
            the coupling/decoupling between the flow and/from heat and/from the mechanics, 
            suitable for varying coupling strength between the three physical processes. 
            We provide a convergence proof for the derived algorithms, and demonstrate their 
            performance through several numerical examples investigating different 
            strengths of the coupling between the different processes.

        Title: "An iterative staggered scheme for phase field brittle fracture 
        propagation with stabilizing parameters"
        Summary: >
            This paper concerns the analysis and implementation of a novel iterative staggered 
            scheme for quasi-static brittle fracture propagation models, where the fracture 
            evolution is tracked by a phase field variable. The model we consider is a 
            two-field variational inequality system, with the phase field function and 
            the elastic displacements of the solid material as independent variables. 
            Using a penalization strategy, this variational inequality system is transformed 
            into a variational equality system, which is the formulation we take as the 
            starting point for our algorithmic developments. The proposed scheme involves 
            a partitioning of this model into two subproblems; phase field and mechanics, 
            with added stabilization terms to both subproblems for improved efficiency 
            and robustness. We analyze the convergence of the proposed scheme using a 
            fixed point argument, and find that under a natural condition, the elastic 
            mechanical energy remains bounded, and, if the diffusive zone around crack 
            surfaces is sufficiently thick, monotonic convergence is achieved. Finally, 
            the proposed scheme is validated numerically with several bench-mark problems.

        Title: "Well-posedness of the fully coupled quasi-static thermo-poroelastic equations 
        with nonlinear convective transport"
        Summary: >
            This paper is concerned with the analysis of the quasi-static thermo-poroelastic 
            model. This model is nonlinear and includes thermal effects compared to the 
            classical quasi-static poroelastic model (also known as Biot's model). 
            It consists of a momentum balance equation, a mass balance equation, and an 
            energy balance equation, fully coupled and nonlinear due to a convective 
            transport term in the energy balance equation. The aim of this article is 
            to investigate, in the context of mixed formulations, the existence and 
            uniqueness of a weak solution to this model problem. The primary variables 
            in these formulations are the fluid pressure, temperature and elastic 
            displacement as well as the Darcy flux, heat flux and total stress. The 
            well-posedness of a linearized formulation is addressed first through 
            the use of a Galerkin method and suitable a priori estimates. This is 
            used next to study the well-posedness of an iterative solution procedure 
            for the full nonlinear problem. A convergence proof for this algorithm is 
            then inferred by a contraction of successive difference functions of the 
            iterates using suitable norms.
