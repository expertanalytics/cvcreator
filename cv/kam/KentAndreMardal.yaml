Summary: |
    I am a Professor of Applied Mathematics, with a PhD from 2003. I have a broad background in programming, 
    computational modeling, image analysis and fluid mechanics. I have educated more than 40 MSc students
    and 15 PhD students, written more than 100 scientific papers on topics ranging from 
    theoretical mathematics to clinical applications, and am experienced in working with and leading multidisciplinary teams. 
Skills:
    Languages:
        - Python, Matlab, C++.
    Frameworks:
        - FEniCS, Numpy, SciPy, FreeSurfer.
SelectedSkills: 
    "Communication": |
        As a presenter, teacher, mentor and supervisor, I frequently present, discuss, and educate technical consepts
        at various levels. Most of my research is interdisciplinary, frequently with experts with domain 
        knowledge very different from my own.  
    "Management": |
       I am currently managing two research projects financed by the Norwegian Research Council 
       "Alzheimer's physics" and "Scientific Machine Learning" of 28 MNOK, in addition
       to participating as workpackage leader in other projects. Hence, I am experience
       in managment.
