Summary: |
    I submitted my master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at the University of
    Oslo in 2016. My educational background is in mathematics and computational science applied on
    mechanical problems using numerical methods. This has fuelled my interest for science and 
    technology. I have mainly used Python and have substantial experience using numerical libraries 
    such as Numpy/Scipy and FEniCS. I am also familiar with C/C++ and Java. My experience include 
    teaching introductory Python at the University of Oslo, mostly in one-to-one settings.
                
    Before joining Expert Analytics I was engaged as a Research Engineer at Simula 
    Research Laboratory. In my thesis I simulated the cerebrospinal fluid flow in patient specific 
    geometries. I solved partial differential equations with the finite element method using 
    supercomputers, both in my master's thesis and during my work at Simula. Through my education 
    and work I have gained significant experience with numerical simulations and mathematical 
    modelling, as well as problem solving in general.

            During the fall of 2016 I worked at the iBrainSafeCloud project at Simula Research 
            Laboratory as a research engineer. The work involved writing a fully decoupled fluid 
            structure interaction solver. Furthermore, we made a web user interface enabling 
            non-expert users to perform simulations on a supercomputer. It was implemented using the 
            Python interface of FEniCS.
