Summary: >
    I am a skillful software developer, researcher, and project leader with 16 years professional experience.
    My main areas of technical expertise are mathematical and numerical software development, algorithm 
    development, advanced scripting with modern scripting languages, parallel programming, software testing 
    and deployment, library design, and scientific visualization.\\

    In 2013, I founded Expert Analytics AS together with Åsmund Ødegård. Since then, my assignments have mostly involved
    writing simulation software in hydrology that combines flexibility and numerical efficiency, and building 
    frameworks for novel analysis of the behavoir of the North European hydropower markets.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "LTM Analysis Desktop for Statkraft"
        Role: "Senior developer and architect"
        Staffing: "Two main developers, and several analysts"
        Description: >
            Analysts at Statkraft use the so called EMPS model to understand the long term behaviour of the North 
            European power market. Although the core of this system is still solid and provides insights, the 
            tools and workflows associated with it is dated at best. To fix this, Statkraft has started a project, 
            the LTM Application Platform, that augments the simulator with a powerful and flexible domain model 
            written in a mixture of Python and C++. The platform both serves as a frontend to the analysts at Statkraft, 
            enabling new ways of viewing results through domain specific transformations, and helps to manage the 
            large amounts of data that is both used as input and produced as results by the EMPS simulator. My role in
            this project has been to define and implement the domain model together with the chief architect at
            Statkraft, and contribute to designe the architecture needed to meet the requirements on efficiency 
            with regards to making the simulation results available to the analyst as soon as possible.
        Tools: "Python, HDF5, Bokeh, Matplotlib, EMPS model, Microsoft HPC Suite"
    A2:
        Activity: "SHyFT development"
        Role: "Senior developer and architect"
        Staffing: "Four developers, several hydrologists"
        Description: >
            Enki was an open source hydrologcal simulation platform developed by SINTEF for Statkraft over a 
            time period of several years. The original implementation, being a proof of concept type research 
            code, was not suited for daily use in an operational setting due to limitations on scalability, 
            design and performance. I was hired in a project to remedy this, and we quickly realized that we 
            needed to reimplement everything from scratch and use the existing code base as a starting point 
            for the algorithmic aspects. The resulting hydrological forcasting toolbox, named SHyFT, is currently
            operationalized and run daily at Statkraft.

    A3:
        Activity:   "mCASH backend development"
        Role:       "Senior Python Developer"
        Staffing:   "12-15 Python developers"
        Description: >
            In this project, I have been working on most parts of the backend of a new mobile payment system. 
            This includes financial transaction handling, the internal bank implementation, messages emitted 
            through various protocols based on recipients, OpenID Connect scopes implementation and payment for 
            these, web handlers for endpoints, and Datastore transaction in the Google app engine, all in Python. 
            I have also rewritten the instrumentation test framework, that does real life scenario, black box 
            testing of the core system. The development is test driven, with tests covering close to 100 percent 
            of the code base, follows the Scrum agile method, and utilizes state-of-the-art technologies like Git 
            for version control, Nose for testing, and Sphinx for documentation.
        Tools: "Python, Google app engine, Git, buildout, nose tests, Sphinx, webapp2, Jinja2, OAuthLib, JSON, html, javascript, jQuery, Pusher"
    A4:
        Activity:   "Computational Middleware, Center for Biomedical Computing"
        Role:       "Leader, scientist and software developer"
        Staffing:   "3-4 scientists and developers"
        Description: >
            As a project leader, I had the responsibility of the technical development, scientific achievements, 
            the economy, and the personnel in the project. The project strongly emphasized the development of 
            reliable, extensible and numerical efficient software components for solving scientific problems through 
            simulations.
