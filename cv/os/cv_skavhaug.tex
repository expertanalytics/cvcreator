\section*{Summary}
I am a capable software developer, researcher, and project leader with 14 years professional experience. My career in Norway’s highest ranked ICT research institution, Simula Research Laboratory and its subsidiaries Kalkulo and Simula Innovation has given me a broad technical and managerial background. My main areas of technical expertise are mathematical and numerical software development, algorithm development, advanced scripting with modern scripting languages, parallel programming, software testing and deployment, library design, and scientific visualization.\\
\\
Through my work, I have obtained an extensive set of skills that allows me to understand and solve challenges in collaboration with other experts. Today, industrial challenges are often multidisciplinary, and involve competences from several fields at once. Hence, to successfully deliver results, communication is key. Modern, agile software development methods facilitate this, and through my work the last ten years, this has been my modus operandi.

\begin{tabular}{@{}LR}
Activity & mCASH backend development\\
Role & Senior Python Developer\\
Staffing & 12-15 Python developers\\
Description & In this project, I am working on most parts of the backend of a new mobile payment system. This includes financial transaction handling, the internal bank implementation, messages emitted through various protocols based on recipients, OpenID Connect scopes implementation and payment for these, web handlers for endpoints, and Datastore transaction in the Google app engine, all in Python. The development is test driven, with tests covering close to 100 percent of the code base, and follows the Scrum agile method. \\
Tools & Python, Google app engine, Git, buildout, nose tests, webapp2, Jinja2, OAuthLib, JSON, html, javascript, jQuery, Pusher\\

Activity & Software for PDEs, Simula Research Laboratory\\
Role & Leader, scientist and software developer\\
Staffing & 6-8 scientists, developers and PhD students for two years\\
Description & Under my responsibility the project defined and developed novel software frameworks for advanced computer simulation and visualization and delivered excellent scientific results. Simula Research Laboratory applied and was awarded a Centre of Excellence by the Research Council of Norway in 2007, where the activity of the "Software for PDEs" became a central component.\\

Activity & Python Computing Components\\
Role & Main developer\\
Description & PyCC is a modern and efficient scripting framework that is used to solve differential equations modelling the electrical activity in the human heart – the so called bidomain equations. The complexity of the problem, and the use of the tool to conduct research, required both flexibility and efficiency. To meet these needs we implemented a high level scripting interface in Python for flexibility, and migrated bottlenecks to low-level extension modules implemented in C/C++ and Fortran. Central activities were library design, interface building strategies, cross language techniques, code generation, and third party software integration.\\
Tools & C/C++, Fortran, Python, Swig, MPI, Subversion, Scons, PETSc, FEniCS, Hypre, BoomerAMG, Diffpack, GNU Compiler Collection and Debugger, Valgrind\\

\begin{tabular}{@{}LR}
Activity & Viper\\
Role & Main developer\\
Description & Viper is a lightweight runtime visualization framework for scientific data and results. It grants the underlying visualization library, VTK, direct access to the simulation result, thereby minimizing memory copies for efficiency. Viper can visualize both scalar and vector data, as well as wireframe geometries (meshes).\\
Tools & C/C++, VTK, Python\\

\begin{tabular}{@{}LR}
Activity & Gotran\\
Role & Main developer\\
Description & Systems of ordinary differential equations are often complex, and implementing these in a numerically efficient way is both time consuming and error prone. To remedy this, I have implemented Gotran – a compiler that takes ODEs described in a high level DSL (domain specific language) and generates highly specific and numerically efficient C/C++ code. By building on top of another software project I have implemented, Swiginac, Gotran utilizes symbolic manipulation during several of the code transformations to reduce the number of floating point operations needed to evaluate the ODE systems during simulation.\\
Tools & C/C++, Python, Swiginac, Swig\\

\begin{tabular}{@{}LR}
Activity & Swiginac - extending Python with symbolic mathematics\\
Role & Main developer\\
Staffing & Open source project with several contributors\\
Description & Swiginac is a symbolic mathematics module for Python. It is built by exposing GiNaC, a symbolic manipulation library written in C++ to Python with Swig. The efficiency of the underlying C++ library makes Swiginac one of the fastest technologies in its class in Python, and the possibilities of writing expressions in various ways makes Swiginac well suited for code generation purposes. Swiginac was developed as a side project during my PhD, in order to make a system for automatic code verification of numerical simulators.\\

\begin{tabular}{@{}LR}
Activity & Famms - automatic code verification for PDEs\\
Role & Main developer\\
Description & Standard PDE problems can be formulated as $F(u)=0$, where $F$ is a possibly non--linear system of differential equations. The task is then to find the unknown $u$. By selecting a manufactured, analytical solution instead, called $v$, we can compute $b=F(v)$. Then by defining $G = F(v)-b$, we again obtain a standard problem on the form $G(v)=0$. Forgetting that we know $v$, we can try to solve the last equation to see if the numerical simulator is working as expected. The method above is commonly referred to as the method of manufactures solutions, and Famms, the software system I implemented, automates this process by calculating both $b$ and the perturbed problem $G$ with minimal effort.\\
Tools & C/C++, Python, Swig, Swiginac, Diffpack, FEniCS, PyCC.\\

Role & Developer and project leader\\

Description & In this project, a California based software company in biomedicine wanted to incorporate some of the technology I had developed into their commercial code to strengthen the finite element analysis and visualization capabilities of their software. Over a period of six months, we successfully integrated the components into their code, such that they could us PyCC and Viper.\\

Role & Main developer \\

Description & Symphonical is a web-based collaboration tool. Initially it was conceived as a tool for running agile software development projects based on the metaphor of post-it notes on a virtual wall, a scope that since has been widened. We created the first prototype of the system, in 2005, before it was spun out as a company and developed further by others. \\
