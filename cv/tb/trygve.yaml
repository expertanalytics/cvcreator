        Description: >
                     Trygve worked with the development of price forecasting models based on machine learning
                     for the intraday- and regulating power markets, whose function is to resolve imbalances
                     between production and consumption in the power grid.
                     The models were set in production on Cognite's cloud infrastructure, and a GUI was built
                     for traders to view the predictions in a context to help in their decision making.
