Summary: >
    I am a mathematician with a love of teaching. I enjoy explaining hard concepts, both in a one-to-many and one-to-one setting. I enjoy encountering new problems, and spending time thinking of creative solutions. As a software consultant I have learned how to build robust software and write clean and maintainable code. As a programmer I enjoy working in the intersection between mathematical problems and implementing them in software. I especially like visualizations, and have some experience in UX patterns for mobile and web platforms.
