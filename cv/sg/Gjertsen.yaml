Summary: >
    I hold a masters degree in applied mathematics from the University of Oslo and Simula Research Labratory, finished in 2017.
    In my thesis I built a Fluid-Structure Interaction solver with Python using the FEniCS platform. This also included working with
    supercomputers parallelizing the computational efforts.
    During my studies I gained knowledge in algorithms, numerical computing and programming in different languages.

    \\
    After graduating I worked for Shortcut AS, an app-development company, developing iOS apps and working with Splunk for monitoring and
    analyzing machine-generated big data, detailed more below. I have also taken courses and attended conferences on AI/Machine Learning, learning neural networks
    using Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn.

    Machine learning: >
         While working for Shortcut I took courses in machine learning, learning about neural networks, recommender systems etc.
         Using frameworks such TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, programming in Python and Matlab.
         Course certificate: \url{https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/EHGJT2SFVHVK}.
         I was also involved in the initial phases of setting up a recommender system for a client while working for Shortcut.
    Programming: >
         I am most familiar with Python because of the extensive use in my studies, but I also have an understanding of Java, C/C++.
         I love programming and I am always interested in, and consider myself quickly adaptable to, new programming languages.
         In my studies and in my working experience I have used GitHub and I am familiar with agile software development.
