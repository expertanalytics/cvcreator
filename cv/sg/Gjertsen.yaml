Summary: >
    I hold a masters degree in applied mathematics from the University of Oslo and Simula Research Labratory, finished in 2017.
    In my thesis I built a Fluid-Structure Interaction solver with Python using the FEniCS platform. This also included working with
    supercomputers parallelizing the computational efforts.
    During my studies I gained knowledge in algorithms, numerical computing and programming in different languages.


    After graduating I worked for Shortcut AS, an app-development company, developing iOS apps and working with Splunk for monitoring and
    analyzing machine-generated big data. I have also taken courses and attended conferences on AI/Machine Learning, learning neural networks
    using Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn.
    Apart from that I am highly adaptable to any situation and can quickly learn new languages and frameworks.

SelectedSkills:
    Machine learning: >
         While working for Shortcut I took courses in machine learning, learning about neural networks, recommender systems etc.
         Using frameworks such TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, programming in Python and Matlab.
         Course certificate: \url{https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/EHGJT2SFVHVK}.
         I was also involved in the initial phases of setting up a recommender system for a client while working for Shortcut.
    Programming: >
         I am most familiar with Python because of the extensive use in my studies, but I also have an understanding of Java, C/C++.
         I love programming and I am always interested in, and consider myself quickly adaptable to, new programming languages.
         In my studies and in my working experience I have used GitHub and I am familiar with agile software development.

          Now I play somewhat frequently with a lower division team in Oslo.
Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: REMA1000, {\AE} app with over 1 million users.
        Role: "Splunk Coordinator, iOS developer"
        Staffing: "Shortcut, Bouvet, Communicate, SopraSteria, Stix, Verifone and Visma"
        Description: >
            {\AE} is an app by REMA1000 to help consumers save money and keep track of their purchases.
            My job was to use the Splunk tool to overview the API calls made by the app to several endpoints, and
            to set up automatic alarm systems to warn for excessive error codes.
            I also worked as a iOS developer on this project.
        Tools: "Splunk"
