Summary: >
    I am a geophysicist with an M.Sc. from the University of Oslo specializing on geophysical and seismological applications. During my 
    thesis work I developed and applied convolutional neural networks to pre-stack seismic data for noise attenuation.
    I gained solid insight into machine learning tools such as Keras and Tensorflow as well as specialized tooling for
    seismology like SEGY-files and common seismic workflows. The skills I obtained form this work was further improved
    during my stay at Lundin Norway AS where I worked on similar projects enhancing and applying convolutional neural 
    networks on post-stack seismic data. I have extensively used Python, making me highly proficient in this language, 
    but I am also familiar with MATLAB, C++ and Bash.

SelectedSkills:
    Machine Learning: >
        During my thesis work, as well as during my stay at Lundin Norway AS a key focus area revolved around
        developing and applying convolutional neural networks on seismic data for replication and enhancement 
        of various seismic signal processes, such as de-noising and inversion. I have good experience with
        libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
    Programming: >
        Programming has been a key component throught my studies and has become a field of passion. Many courses
        featured a programming aspect, but programming was used in courses which did not as well.
    Seismic Data: >
        Studying Geophysics has given me a good insight in seismic data and seismic signal processing. I
        have also gained experience in industrial workflows during my stay at CGG during my thesis work and Lundin
        as a consultant.
