Summary: >
    I hold a masters degree in Geophysics and Seismology from the University of Oslo, completed in 2019.
    I developed and applied convolutional neural networks to pre-stack seismic data for noise attenuation during my thesis work..
    I gained good insight in tools such as Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy as well as seismic data, SEGY-files and common
    seismic workflows. I further improved during my stay at Lundin Norway AS where I worked on similar
    projects applying neural networks, such as conditional GANs, on post-stack seismic data. I have mainly used Python 
    and Matlab, but I am also familiar with C++ and Bash.

SelectedSkills:
    Machine Learning: >
        During my thesis work, as well as during my stay at Lundin Norway AS a key focus area revolved around
        developing and applying convolutional neural networks on seismic data for replication and enhancement 
        of various seismic signal processes, such as de-noising and inversion. I have good experience with
        libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
    Programming: >
        Programming has been a key component throught my studies and has become a field of passion. Many courses
        featured a programming aspect, but programming was used in courses which did not as well.
    Seismic Data: >
        Studying Geophysics has given me a good insight in seismic data and seismic signal processing. I
        have also gained experience in industrial workflows during my stay at CGG during my thesis work and Lundin
        as a consultant.
