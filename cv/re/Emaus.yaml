Summary: >
    I hold a masters degree in particle physics from the University of Oslo (2018),
    and a certificate of apprenticeship as an electrician from N{\o}rve Viderg{\aa}ende skole 
    (2009). 
    I have been in different jobs with a highly varied work environments; teacher, factory 
    worker, electrician (both for industry and domestic), salesman and conference
    organiser. This has given me broad experience working in both small and large scale projects 
    and with various kinds of people, obtaining experience working in both leading and team 
    positions.

    My thesis consisted of running simulations for two different models (Quark-Gluon String Model 
    and Hadron Resonance Gas Model) to predict experimental observables. The simulations were 
    written in Fortran and apart from running the simulations, I wrote code to systemize and 
    analyze the statistical data, this with Python and C++. 
    \\[12pt] 
    Through courses at the University I have programmed in Python, C/C++ and MatLab. I have 
    experience with parallel programming through C/C++ and Python with the open source libraries 
    OpenMP and MPI on both super computer clusters and local machines. I have also programmed
    differential equation solvers to calculate the orbits of our solar system and the evolution of
    star clusters, and spent a lot of time visualising data, mostly through Python and Matplotlib, 
    creating interactive plots, animations and static graphs.

    In my spare time I have used Linux and Python as my hobby to create for example interactive
    bots for Slack, a team communication software, socket programming with personal servers to
    communicate with Android phones.
    Also working with electronics to create automated and interactive systems, e.g. hydroponics 
    system, using Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

    My latest projects included creating interfaces which talks to REST API's using Python with
    asynchronous calling. This is being used for staff optimisation for the service industry and 
    also open source project for data retrieval from the Frost API.

SelectedSkills:
    Programming: >
        I have mostly programmed in Python during my university years and it is my language of
        choice, if possible, when programming in my spare time. Through different courses I have 
        also programmed in C/C++. Within these courses I have also implemented distributed 
        parallelization in both languages through MPI, running both locally and on super computers.
        I enjoy programming and am adaptable to any programming language that is needed.
