Summary: >
    I hold a PhD in Physics from 2003 specializing in Solar Physics. Since then I have more than 15 years of experience in data mining, image analysis, time-series analysis and spectral analysis. With time I have expanded my research subjects and used different methods including statistical data analysis and signal processing.\\
    I consider myself very perseverant and used to overcome adversity in a scientific environment by being creative, hard-working, and having an analytical mindset. Excellence, accuracy and detail define my scientific work. I have well-proven organisational capabilities. My colleagues regard me as an excellent communicator and an all-terrain asset. I have experience in leading international collaborations, management of grants, student mentoring and scientific outreach. I consider myself a responsible and organised team player.

    "Complex problem solving": >
        I like applying creativity to break down complex problems into smaller parts that can be tackled in an easier way, but keeping the big picture in mind at the same time. Combine methods from different disciplines (or learning new ones) to solve problems.

    "Leadership": >
        Thanks to holding a few research grants involving international collaborations, I have earned experience as project leader and manager. I also feel comfortable as team member where I am organized, structured and a responsible player.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "Observing and understanding flux emergence using IRIS and SST coordinated data. Research project funded by the Research Council of Norway."
        #Period: "start to end"
        Role: "Project leader"
        Staffing: "2 members and 5 collaborators"
        #Volume: "Volume of work (eg.\ percent of full time)"
        Description: >
            This effort aimed at studying how magnetic fields living in the interior of the Sun rise up and trespass the surface of the star while continuing their journey up through the solar atmosphere. The project involves combining big data sets (images and spectra) both from space and ground-based observatories, image analysis, spectral analysis across several wavelengths ranges, student mentoring, statistical analysis, and comparison with numerical simulations.
        #Tools: "tools used"

    A2:
        Activity: "Space and ground-based observations of the solar atmosphere. Research project funded by the Research Council of Norway."
        #Period: "start to end"
        Role: "Project leader and grant holder"
        Staffing: "me, with 4 collaborators"
        #Volume: "Volume of work (eg.\ percent of full time)"
        Description: >
            The goal of this project was to study the lower part of the solar atmosphere at the highest spatial resolution, in order to see the smallest details ever seen on the surface of a star. Both the dynamics and magnetism of the physical processes going on in the surface were studied. The project involved the analysis of big data sets of images and spectra, time series, data reduction (cleaning the data from instrumental affects and make it ready-to-use), feature tracking algorithms, and statistical data analysis.
