Summary: >
    I hold a PhD in Physics from 2003 specializing in Solar Physics. I have 20 years of experience in data processing, image analysis, time-series analysis, spectral analysis and analytical models. With time I have expanded my research subjects and used different methods including statistical data analysis. I have additionally explored various topics within machine learning. \\
    I consider myself very perseverant and used to overcome adversity in a scientific environment by being creative, hard-working, and having an analytical mindset. Excellence, accuracy and detail define my scientific work. I have well-proven organisational capabilities. My colleagues regard me as an excellent communicator and an all-terrain asset. I have experience in leading international collaborations, management of grants, student mentoring and scientific outreach.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "Observing and understanding flux emergence using IRIS and SST coordinated data. Research project funded by the Research Council of Norway."
        Period: "2016-2019"
        Role: "Principal Investigator"
        Staffing: "2 members and 5 collaborators"
        #Volume: "Volume of work (eg.\ percent of full time)"
        Description: >
            This effort aimed at studying how magnetic fields living in the interior of the Sun rise up and trespass the surface of the star while continuing their journey up through the solar atmosphere. In this project, I combined large data sets (images and spectra) both from spacecrafts and ground-based observatories and pre-processed them. In addition, I was in charge of carrying out the data analysis, which required developing specific scientific coding for image analysis, spectral analysis, statistical analysis, and comparison with numerical simulations. I was responsible for several scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals and for presentation of the results in international conferences.
#            I supervised a MSc. student, and mentored several Ph.D students.

        #Volume: "Volume of work (eg.\ percent of full time)"
        Description: >
            The goal of this project was to study the lower part of the solar atmosphere at the highest spatial resolution. Both the dynamics and magnetism of the physical processes going on in the surface were studied. For this project I pre-processed large astronomical data sets of images and spectra (cleaning the data from instrumental effects and making them ready-to-use). I developed the programming codes in order to analyse images, time series, create feature tracking algorithms, and statistical data analysis. I was the main author in the resulting articles published in international peer-reviewed journals, and presentations in conferences.
