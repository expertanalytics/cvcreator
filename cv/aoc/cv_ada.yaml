Summary: >
    I am a physicist with 20 years of experience in academia in the field of Astrophysics. I hold a PhD in Physics from 2003. My expertise includes image analysis, time-series analysis, signal processing, feature recognition and analytical models. With time I expanded my research topics and used different methods including statistical data analysis. In 2019 I moved to the private industry sector where I started using machine learning algorithms. \\
    I consider myself perseverant and used to overcome adversity in a scientific environment by being creative, hard-working, and having an analytical mindset. Excellence, accuracy and detail define my scientific work. My colleagues regard me as an excellent communicator and an all-terrain asset. I have experience in leading international collaborations, management of research grants, student mentoring and scientific outreach.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "Audio Analytics predictive maintenance in Hydropower"
        Period: "2020"
        Role: "Data Scientist"
        Staffing: "team of 6"
        Description: >
            This project investigates whether analysing audio profiles from heavy rotating machinery (hydropower generators) and applying deep learning algorithms can help identifying and isolating faulty units. We take a non-invasive approach that allows continuation of power production while predictive maintenance is being carried out. I contributed to the Machine Learning team developing appropiate signal processing algorithms to be run on edge devices. I was involved in defining the analytical solution as well as in the maintenance of the infrastructure which involves edge devices and a cloud services platform.
            This project is very novel and poses a research challenge. As such, the project is showcased as the Norwegian user-case in a H2020-ECSEL grant application in which Expert Analytics is a partner.

    A2:
        Activity: "Observing and understanding flux emergence using IRIS and SST coordinated data. Research project funded by the Research Council of Norway."
        Period: "2016-2019"
        Role: "Principal Investigator"
        Staffing: "2 members and 5 collaborators"
        Description: >
            This effort aimed at studying how magnetic fields living in the interior of the Sun rise up and trespass the surface of the star while continuing their journey up through the solar atmosphere. In this project, I combined large data sets (images and spectra) both from spacecrafts and ground-based observatories and pre-processed them. In addition, I was in charge of carrying out the data analysis, which required developing specific scientific coding for image analysis, spectral analysis, statistical analysis, and comparison with numerical simulations. I was responsible for several scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals and for presentation of the results in international conferences.

        Activity: "Space and ground-based observations of the solar atmosphere. Research project funded by the Research Council of Norway."
        Period: "2011-2013"
        Role: "Principal Investigator, Project leader"
        Staffing: "me, with 4 collaborators"
        Description: >
            The goal of this project was to study the lower part of the solar atmosphere at the highest spatial resolution. Both the dynamics and magnetism of the physical processes going on in the surface were studied. For this project I pre-processed large astronomical data sets of images and spectra (cleaning the data from instrumental effects and making them ready-to-use). I developed the programming codes in order to analyse images, time series, create feature tracking algorithms, and statistical data analysis. I was the main author in the resulting articles published in international peer-reviewed journals, and presentations in conferences.

            I am in charge of organizing and managing a series of posts in social media about the Sun and the European Solar Telescope (EST) project in order to educate the general public about the importance of studying our nearest star. Through this project I delivered public lectures at Queen's University Belfast and the University of Oslo aimed for the general public. I am editor of two books for the EST project with the goal of educating society in the Sun and the Universe. Also in charge of dissemination activities in Norway related to the EST project.
