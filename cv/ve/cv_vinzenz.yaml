		Activity: ve3 - virtual commissioning software
		Role: Developer
		Staffing: 2 developers
		Description: >
			Realtime simulation software for the virtual commissioning of production systems,
			simulating the material flow based on physical laws.
			I was working manly with refactoring in addition to adding new features such
			as fluids based on smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and flexible machine parts
			and process goods.

		Role: Main developer and researcher
		Staffing: 1-2 researchers
		Description: >
			STARFiSh is an open-source simulation program to simulate
			blood flow in arterial networks with stochastic input parameters.
			The software combines an advanced one-dimensional
			fluid-structure-interaction code with methods for
			uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
			I wrote the software as part of my Ph.D. thesis.

	esa:
		Activity: The Planck Legacy Archive Added Value Interface (European Space Agency)
		Staffing: 5 developers
		Description: >
			The Planck Legacy Archive is a website aimed at giving the general
			public the opportunity to access and use data from the ESA Planck satellite.
			In 2015 ESA started work on implementing an Added Value Interface to this website,
			which aims to allow users to manipulate and analyse data online before downloading,
			using various data cleaning and analysis techniques.
			My role in this project was to profile the memory usage of all analysis
			and map manipulation algorithms. The analysis results helded to determine the optimal size and
			type of the asynchronous workers spawned on all virtual machines.
			As consequence, the system handles all user requests in the most efficient way.
		Role: Profiling of the system performance
		Tools: Python, Docker, ANOVA

	sk_ltm:
		Activity: Statkraft - Longterm Power Management - Visualization
		Role: Main developer and architect
		Staffing: 1 developer
		Description: >
			In Statkraft, Longterm Power Management is based on numerical simulations of complex water way systems,
			including reservoirs, power stations, and pumps. For the analysis and usage of these simulation results,
			visualization tools are needed. The goal was to visualize all data in a convenient and accessible manner
			via web services based on Bokeh.
			The projekt resulted in a dashboard suite which enables fast and intuitively creation of web dashboards.
			Statkaft published the suite as Open Source Software among it's Shyft application.
			The dashboard suite has an integrated time series viewer to visualized large amount of high frequent data
			in a fast and effective manner. Also, graph visualization tools are included, which are for example used to
			auto-generate and visualize the topology of arbitrary water way systems at run time.
			The visualization tool is now used by several projects in Statkraft.

	sk_wind_turbines:
	  Activity: Root cause analysis in Windturbines
	  Staffing: 2 analysts
	  Description: >
		Random failing equipment in windturbines lead to losses in the magnitude of millions for our customer. With the analysis of weather and production data we determined the root cause and could suggest actions to save the remaining equipment and keep the production up. With a lifetime predictor we could estimate the remaining lifetime of each turbine individually. Due to the data driven mitigation action we proposed equipment was saved, and the losses considerably limited.
	  Role: Main analyst
	  Tools: Python, NumPy, Statsmodel, ANOVA, ARIMA, Pandas

	sk_machine_learning_platform:
        Activity: Statkraft - Machine learning platform
        Staffing: 2 developer
        Description: >
            Statkraft wanted a common platform to scale and facilitate machine learning projects from the explorative phase
            to production.
            We designed and implemented a flexible and scalable solution that allows for the integration of all common machine
            learning libraries into one framework. With our framework machine learning workflows can be defined,
            run and shared among teams. The unique feature is that its fast and lightweight backend
            is optimized to run ml-workflows in production on Statkraft's systems.
            This enables a fast transition from prototypes to validated and tested production code.
