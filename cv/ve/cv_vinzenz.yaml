Summary: >
    I am a curious, pragmatic, creative problem solver.
    I hold a PhD in biomechanical engineering, focusing on stochastic 
    simulations of the blood flow in the human arterial system.
    This interdisciplinary work included working within engineering, medicine, biology, 
    software development and statistics.
    My educational background is in mechanical engineering, with focus on numerical
    methods and bio-materials.
    Beside my studies, I worked in several different fields such as virtual commissioning, petroleum research,
    biomechanics research.
    My educational and work experience gave me strong analytic skills, the ability to
    see problems from different angles and strengthened my communications skills.
    In the last years I was mainly programming in Python, which I have used to
    write a comprehensive simulation software.
    I am also familiar with other languages, like C and C++, and can easily adapt beyond this.

        Description: >
            STARFiSh is an open-source simulation program to simulate
            blood flow in arterial networks with stochastic input parameters.
            The software combines an advanced one-dimensional
            fluid-structure-interaction code with methods for
            uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
            I wrote the software as part of my Ph.D. thesis.

    A2:
        Activity: The Planck Legacy Archive Added Value Interface (European Space Agency)
        Staffing: 5 developers
        Description: >
            The Planck Legacy Archive is a website aimed at giving the general
            public the opportunity to access and use data from the ESA Planck satellite.
            In 2015 ESA started work on implementing an Added Value Interface to this website,
            which aims to allow users to manipulate and analyse data online before downloading,
            using various data cleaning and analysis techniques. 
            My role in this project is to profile the memory usage of all analysis
            and map manipulations algorithms. This knowledge is used to control the size of the asynchronous 
            workers spawned on all virtual machines.
            As consequence, all user requests are handled in the most efficient way. 
        Role: Profiling of the system performance
        Tools: Python, Docker, ANOVA
        
    A1:
        Activity: Statkraft - Longterm Power Management - Visualization
        Staffing: 1 developer
        Description: >
            In Statkraft, Longterm Power Management is based on numerical simulations of complex water way systems,
            including reservoirs, power stations, and pumps. For the analysis and usage of these simulation results,
            visualization tools are needed. All results are visualized via web services based on Bokeh to present
            the data in a convenient and accessible manner. For a fast understanding of the topology of the
            simulated  water  way  systems, a schematic map is needed. The project goal is to implement a visualization
            module to auto-generate layout and interactive web visualization of arbitrary water way systems at run time.
        Role: Main developer
        Tools: Python, DOT, GraphViz, Boukeh, NumPy, XML, Yaml, Json
