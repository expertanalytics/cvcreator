    Role: Developer
    Staffing: 2 developers
    Description: >
      Realtime simulation software for the virtual commissioning of production systems,
      simulating the material flow based on physical laws.
      I was working manly with refactoring in addition to adding new features such
      as fluids based on smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and flexible machine parts
      and process goods.

    Activity: STARFiSh - stochastic arterial flow simulation
    Role: Main developer and researcher
    Staffing: 1-2 researchers
    Description: >
      STARFiSh is an open-source simulation program to simulate
      blood flow in arterial networks with stochastic input parameters.
      The software combines an advanced one-dimensional
      fluid-structure-interaction code with methods for
      uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
      I wrote the software as part of my Ph.D. thesis.

  A7:
    Activity: The Planck Legacy Archive Added Value Interface (European Space Agency)
    Staffing: 5 developers
    Description: >
      The Planck Legacy Archive is a website aimed at giving the general
      public the opportunity to access and use data from the ESA Planck satellite.
      In 2015 ESA started work on implementing an Added Value Interface to this website,
      which aims to allow users to manipulate and analyse data online before downloading,
      using various data cleaning and analysis techniques.
      My role in this project was to profile the memory usage of all analysis
      and map manipulation algorithms. The analysis results helded to determine the optimal size and
      type of the asynchronous workers spawned on all virtual machines.
      As consequence, the system handles all user requests in the most efficient way.
    Role: Profiling of the system performance
    Tools: Python, Docker, ANOVA
  
  A6:
    Activity: Statkraft - Longterm Power Management - Visualization
    Role: Main developer and architect
    Staffing: 1 developer
    Description: >
      In Statkraft, Longterm Power Management is based on numerical simulations of complex water way systems,
      including reservoirs, power stations, and pumps. For the analysis and usage of these simulation results,
      visualization tools are needed. The goal was to visualize all data in a convenient and accessible manner
      via web services based on Bokeh.
      The projekt resulted in a dashboard suite which enables fast and intuitively creation of web dashboards.
      Statkaft published the suite as Open Source Software among it's Shyft application.
      The dashboard suite has an integrated time series viewer to visualized large amount of high frequent data
      in a fast and effective manner. Also, graph visualization tools are included, which are for example used to
      auto-generate and visualize the topology of arbitrary water way systems at run time.
      The visualization tool is now used by several projects in Statkraft.
    Tools: Python, DOT, GraphViz, Bokeh, NumPy, XML, Yaml, Json
  
  A5:
    Activity: Root cause analysis in Windturbines
    Staffing: 2 analysts
    Description: >
      Random failing equipment in windturbines lead to losses in the magnitude of millions for our customer.
      With the analysis of weather and production data we determined the root cause and could suggest actions to save
      the remaining equipment and keep the production up.
      With a lifetime predictor we could estimate the remaining lifetime of each turbine individually.
      Due to the data driven mitigation action we proposed equipment was saved, and the losses considerably limited.
      
    Role: Main analyst
    Tools: Python, NumPy, Statsmodel, ANOVA, ARIMA, Pandas
  
  A4:
    Activity: Statkraft - Machine learning platform
    Staffing: 2 developer
    Description: >
      Statkraft wanted a common platform to scale and facilitate machine learning projects from the explorative phase
      to production.
      We designed and implemented a flexible and scalable solution that allows for the integration of all common machine
      learning libraries into one framework. With our framework machine learning workflows can be defined,
      run and shared among teams. The unique feature is that its fast and lightweight backend
      is optimized to run ml-workflows in production on Statkraft's systems.
      This enables a fast transition from prototypes to validated and tested production code.
    Role: Main developer and architect
    Tools: Python, Yaml, Json, HDBSCAN, scicit-learn, keras, tensorflow
  
  A3:
    Activity: Statkraft - Predictive Maintenance for Hydropower
    Staffing: 2 developer
    Description: >
      For Statkraft I developed the backend system for predictive mainteance in hydro power.
      The backend system includes a versioned domain model, infrastructure to define, test, run and deploy machine learning models, data management and visualisation.
      In addition, I helped with the data analysis and implementation of the first predictive maintenance model.
    Role: Main developer and architect
    Tools: Python, Bokeh, NumPy, Json, REST, Azure
  
  A2:
    Activity: Arundo - Domain Modelling
    Staffing: 4 - 8 developer
    Description: >
      In Arundo, I supported the development of the domain model for a data processing engine for
      predictive maintenance simulations.
      In addition, I was part of a small team to design and implement the core of a standardized domain modelling
      language framework which could be applied to many projects.
      The framework would allow modeling physical domains of customer's assets and track changes over time.
    Role: Developer
    Tools: Python, NumPy, Yaml, Json, networkX, DOT, GraphViz

    Activity: Edge Audio Analytics - MVP
    Staffing: 8 developer
    Description: >
      We in Expert Analytics joined forces with Statkraft to evaluate in an R\&D project the usefulness of audio
      surveillance to measure the health state of heavy machinery in particular hydro power generators.
      We developed an MVP for an audio analysis system with Siemens industry computers.
      The edge system was installed at a power plant to record the acoustic emissions of 3 generators and 2 transformers
      with 8 microphones. The high frequent audio data (48k samples/s) is analysed on side with machine learning models.
      An edge backend system facilitates data acquisition, data saving, model scheduling, result transfer to the cloud,
      edge fleet management and code/model deployment to the edge. I was in charge of the backend architecture and design,
      as well as the audio hardware selection. In addition, I implemented most of the data acquisition,
      and the edge compute engine which executes the machine learning models.
      After running for 2 months we already detected 2 concerning malfunctions in different equipment.
      The project is ongoing until 2022.
