Summary: >
    I have a masters degree in Computation Physics from the University of Oslo, completed in 2018.
    My project revolved around many-body quantum mechanical systems. During the project I gained a
    good set of skills with knowledge in numerical methods, efficient algorithmic approaches,
    symbolic computations, high-performance- and parallel computing and programming in several
    different languages.

    I have gained skills in software development and also data analysis from the different projects
    in immunotherapy and datamodel building in powersystems.

SelectedSkills:
    Programming: >
        I enjoy programming both professionally and in my spare time. My skill set is mostly in
        Python and C$\nolinebreak[3]\hspace{-0.01em}\raisebox{.2ex}{\small{++}}$, but I have been
        tinkering with different languages such as Java, Fortran, Perl, Lua and JavaScript, as well
        as tinkering in linux and fixing my tools. Escpesially my vimrc file.
    Problem solving: >
        Learning new methods and applying them to new and interesting problems is a passion I have
        kept since I started my studies in 2013. Everything from digging into complex algorithms,
        applied mathematics and everything associated to solving the complex problems which arise
        are skills I have gained through having a genuine interest in solving problems and learning
        new tools and methods.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity:   Consultant at Statnett SF 
        Role:       Consultant
        Staffing:   4 developers, project management and one domain specialist
        Volume:     "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            Create software for fully automated extraction of data from Statnett SF platforms into
            Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) platform. The goal was to build a data model which captures
            contextual information about components in the powergrid and the electrical
            connectivity. The work was mainly R\&D with proof of concept solutions and integrating
            said solutions into a clean codebase and deploy on openshift. The work also involved
            integrity checks of the data stream into CDF.
        Tools: python, pandas, numpy, docker, openshift, sparql, cognite-sdk
    A2:
        Activity:   Software Developer for OncoImmunity
        Period:     2018-2019
        Role:       Consultant
        Staffing:   8 developers
        Volume:     "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            OncoImmunity develops software in bioinformatics with purpose of improving the precision
            of imunotherapy. My role was to further develop existing code on machine-learning
            methods which used genomic data and also help with making the code ready for production
            and deployment by integrating code between
            C$\nolinebreak[3]\hspace{-0.01em}\raisebox{.2ex}{\small{++}}$ and Python.
        Tools: Python, Keras, C$\nolinebreak[3]\hspace{-0.01em}\raisebox{.2ex}{\small{++}}$, Pybind11, Cython
