Summary: >
    I have a masters degree in Computation Physics from the University of Oslo, completed in 2018.
    My project revolved around many-body quantum mechanical systems. During the project I gained a
    good set of skills with knowledge in numerical methods, efficient algorithmic approaches,
    symbolic computations, high-performance- and parallel computing and programming in several
    different languages.

SelectedSkills:
    Programming: >
        I enjoy programming both professionally and in my spare time. My skill set is mostly in
        Python and C$\nolinebreak[3]\hspace{-0.01em}\raisebox{.2ex}{\small{++}}$, but I have been
        tinkering with different languages such as Java, Fortran, Perl, Lua and JavaScript.
    Problem solving: >
        Learning new methods and applying them to new and interesting problems is a passion I have
        kept since I started my studies in 2013. Everything from digging into complex algorithms,
        applied mathematics and everything associated to solving the complex problems which arise
        are skills I have gained through having a genuine interest in solving problems and learning
        new tools and methods.

        Activity:   Software Developer for OncoImmunity
        Period:     2018-2019
        Role:       Consultant
        Staffing:   8 developers
        Volume:     "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            OncoImmunity develops software in bioinformatics with purpose of improving the
            precision of imunotherapy. My role was to further develop existing code on
            machine-learning methods which used genomic data and also help with making the code
            ready for production and deployment by integrating code between
            C$\nolinebreak[3]\hspace{-0.01em}\raisebox{.2ex}{\small{++}}$ and Python.
        Tools: Python, Keras, C$\nolinebreak[3]\hspace{-0.01em}\raisebox{.2ex}{\small{++}}$, Pybind11, Cython
