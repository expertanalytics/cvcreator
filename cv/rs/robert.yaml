Summary: >
    I submitted my thesis in Computational Physics for the degree of M.Sc. in the fall of 2019. 
    In my thesis project, I investigated the application of machine learning to a nuclear 
    physics experiment. At the same time, I held a position as a research assistant at the 
    department of physics. My education and experience have given me a strong analytical 
    background. In particular, I am proficient in efficient numerical programming in multiple 
    languages, advanced machine learning techniques, data processing and database management. 

    As a consultant for Expert Analytics I have developed solutions for power-grid modelling and data ingestion
    for Statnett SF.

SelectedSkills:
    Machine Learning: >
        In my master's studies a large focus was placed on understanding and developing neural network models.
        I have extensive experience with the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, as well as experience with PyTorch.
        As a research assistant I was involved in the machine learning group at the Centre for Computing in Science Education.
        In this work I used neural network models as well as tree-based, classical and support vector algorithms.
    Programming: >
       Programming has been a passion of mine from the start of my University education. Most 
       courses featured a programming aspect, and this fostered a growing interest 
       in exploring new technologies. 
    Problem solving: >
       In my studies and work I have been challenged with hard interdisciplinary problems. These challenges 
       have given me an understanding of how to approach and disect such problems to find effective solutions.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "Consultant at Statnett SF"
        Staffing: "4 Developers, project management and domain specialist support"
        Description : >
            Developed solutions for representing the power grid model Statnett SF maintains, in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF). The model captures contextual information about components, as well as
            electrical connectivity. Additionally, we implemented a pipeline from Statnett's data streaming platform to the contextualized model in CDF. The project also involved coding for the integrity 
            of data ingestion, and several proofs of concept solutions to common power-analysis tasks.
        Tools: "Python, SPARQL, Cognite Data Fusion, Pandas, Numpy"
    A2:
        Activity: "Autoencoder methods for track identification in the AT-TPC"
        Staffing: "4 Researchers"
        Description: >
            The AT-TPC detector at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University requires efficient identification of rections occuring in the detector.
            Investigating the aplication of autoencoder neural networks to the identification of these reactions was the topic of my master's thesis. The project involved the construction
            of a semi-supervised approach to measure the amount of labelled data needed to perform classification. In addition to the semi-supervised approach we investigated
            autoencoder based clustering algorithms for entirely unsupervised learning of the different reaction types. This work led to a paper submitted to the journal Nuclear Instruments and Methods, currently in review.
        Tools: "Python, Tensorflow, Keras"
    A3:
        Activity: "Examining the relationship between student performance and video interactions"
        Staffing: "3 Researchers"
        Description: >
            As part of my work as a research assistant I investigated whether one can predict delayed performance outcomes from video interactions.
            The project involved taking raw timestamped interactions with topical videos in a physics lab course. These interactions were used to predict
            student performance on a presentation tied to the topics presented in the videos.
            This work lead to a paper published in the proceedings of the Physics Education Research Conference 2017.
