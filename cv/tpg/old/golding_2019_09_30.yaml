Summary: >
    Thomas is interested in bringing to life the potential of data for AI, automation and insight purposes. 
    He will happily engage in the steps of such a process, from analysis and machine learning to data collection and 
    software development.

    Thomas holds a PhD in astrophysics for developing and studying models of the solar atmosphere. After finishing the
    PhD he worked as an analyst in the public sector. Here he took part in the business intelligence process 
    as well as data analyses, data modeling and system architecting. Thomas also completed the two year

        PhD in astrophysics, UiO. Physical processes in the solar atmosphere. The work included 
        building mathematical and numerical representiontions of the physical system. The numerical 
        model served as an experiment and a basis for analysis. Research results 
        were published in scientific journals and presented at conferences.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "New pension premium system at Statens pensjonskasse"
        Period: "04/2017-09/2017"
        Role: "Developer for a premium forecast model"
        Staffing: "3 developers and 7 analysts"
        Volume: "50\\%"
        Description: >
            The organization was moving a large part of their customers to a new pension 
            premium system. How the premiums were computed changed, and this had consequences 
            for a large part of the organization. Thomas was responsible for developing the 
            premium forecast system. He built a mathematical 
            description of the model and implemented in a computer program. He designed the 
            data flow and automated data queries. The various components were built into 
            a software package.
        Tools: "R, SQL, Jira"
    A2:
        Activity: "Building a data pipeline at Statens pensjonskasse"
        Period: "10/2017-01/2018"
        Role: "Developer and architect"
        Staffing: "2 developers"
        Volume: "50\\%"
        Description: >
            Thomas identified a bottle neck in one of the organization's central processes. He suggested, 
            designed, implemented and saw through the realization of a data pipeline 
            for data from different sub processes. The solution included new software for 
            the transform and load of business data, as well as a centralized data base for storage.
            The project presented a unification of data from the relevant sub processes into one standard 
            data model. The solution resulted in higher efficiency and paved the way for future automation.
        Tools: "R, SQL, Jira"
    A3:
        Activity: "PhD - numerical modeling of the solar atmosphere"
        Period: "08/2012-02/2017"
        # Role: "Qlikview development"
        # Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: >
            Thomas studied how time dependent atomic processes affect the temperature and overall 
            state of the solar atmosphere. To do this he developed a mathematical description of 
            the problem and translated it into a computer algorithm. He implemented the algorithm 
            in a parallel computer code for simulating the sun. Numerical models were 
            produced by running the code on supercomputers. The numerical models 
            were used to analyse interaction between solar gas and light. In particular how temperature 
            and ability to emit light changed due to the time dependent atomic process.
            The efforts resulted in four academic papers in the project, three of these as the first author. 
            All four papers were published in peer-reviewed journals.

        Activity: "Teach First Norway candidate"
        Period: "07/2010-06/2012"
        Description: >
            Candidates work as teachers in challenging schools in Oslo at the same time as they are 
            following a demanding development and training program. The program revolves around the 
            pupil's learning outcome through the candidate's progress as teachers and leaders.
            Thomas worked 2 years as a teacher in Gran skole at Furuset in Oslo. Here he taught maths 
            and science from 4th-10th grade (10-16 year). Simultaneously he completed formal teacher 
            training the first year and a leadership program at Equinor the second year.
