        Description: >
            The organization was moving a large part of their customers to a new pension 
            premium system. The business rules for calculating pension premiums changed, and this had consequences 
            for a large part of the organization. Thomas was responsible for developing the 
            premium forecast system. He built a mathematical 
            description of the model and implemented in a computer program. He designed the 
            data flow and automated the data queries. The various components were built into 
            a software package.
        Tools: "R, SQL, Jira"

        Role: "Developer and architect"
        Staffing: "2 developers"
        Volume: "50\\%"
        Description: >
            Thomas identified a bottle neck in one of the organization's central processes. He suggested, 
            designed, implemented and saw through the realization of a data pipeline 
            for data from different sub processes. The solution included new software for 
            the transform and load of business data, as well as a centralized data base for storage.
            The project presented a unification of data from the relevant sub processes into one standard 
            data model. The solution resulted in higher efficiency and paved the way to further automation.

    A5:
        Activity: "PhD - numerical modeling of the solar atmosphere"
        Period: "08/2012-02/2017"
        # Role: "Qlikview development"
        # Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: >
            Thomas studied how time dependent atomic processes affect the temperature and overall 
            state of the solar atmosphere. To do this he developed a mathematical description of 
            the problem and translated it into a computer algorithm. He implemented the algorithm 
            in a parallel computer code for simulating the sun. Numerical models were 
            produced by running the code on supercomputers. The numerical models 
            were used to analyse interaction between solar gas and light. In particular how temperature 
            and ability to emit light changed due to the time dependent atomic process.
            The efforts resulted in four academic papers in the project, three of these as the first author. 
            All four papers were published in peer-reviewed journals.

        Period: "07/2010-06/2012"
        Description: >
            Candidates work as teachers in challenging schools in Oslo at the same time as they are 
            following a demanding development and training program. The program revolves around the 
            pupil's learning outcome through the candidate's progress as teachers and leaders.
            Thomas worked 2 years as a teacher in Gran skole at Furuset in Oslo. Here he taught maths 
            and science from 4th-10th grade (10-16 year). Simultaneously he completed formal teacher 
            training the first year and a leadership program at Equinor the second year.

        Title: "Formation of the helium extreme-UV resonance lines"
        Summary: >
            Classical modeling of the helium resonance lines of the sun produce intensities roughly an order of magnitude lower than observed values.
            We find and explain how the modeled helium resonance line intensities are comparable to observed values when including the effects of
            thick radiative transfer and time dependent ionization in the models. The work was done by producing and analyzing numerical models
            of the solar atmosphere.

        Summary: >
            We simulate images of the helium 1033 nm line. The line forms as ionized helium recombines into the lower energy level 
            and increases the opacity. We describe the most important mechanisms responsible for this recombination and its spatial distribution.

        Summary: >
            We develop a model to simulate the solar atmosphere taking into account non-equilibrium ionzation of helium. The code was tested
            in 2D. We conclude that non-equilibrium ionzation of helium is important for the thermodynamic structure and diagnostics of the upper 
            chromosphere and lower corona.

        Title: "Detailed and Simplified Nonequilibrium Helium Ionization in the Solar Atmosphere"
        Summary: >
            We carry out detailed 1D simulations of the solar atmosphere and find that the dominant process in the ionization of helium is 
            photoionizaiton and direct collisional ionization, counteracted 
            by radiative recombination cascades. Based on this we develop a simplified description of the physics, suitable for implementing
            in multidimensional models where more elaborate physics is prohibited by limitations in computing power.
