Summary: >
    In essence, I am a problem solver who relies on my scientific knowledge and programming skills to tackle difficult industrial problems. 
    I have a PhD in Aerospace Engineering (2011-2014) and before joining Expert Analytics I held two postdoctoral positions in Applied Mathematics (2014-2016 and 2016-2019).


    After moving to the industry sector, I worked as a consultant within digitalization for international Oil \& Gas companies. 
    By leveraging my knowledge both in multiphase fluid mechanics and programming, I helped them optimize production (anomaly detection algorithms) and automate human tasks (script programming).
    My experience in academia allows me to provide creative ways to attack difficult industrial problems and for the client is a guarantee of a solid solution. 
    Moreover, I have experience in tackling problems in a timely manner, adjusting to the needs of the customer and thus guaranteeing a timely deliver for the solutions.
    
    
    I have a large experience in working with multidisciplinary teams and thrive in such environments. 
    I'm considered by my peers as an excellent speaker and someone who is able to communicate well both with technical people and with stakeholders.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: Automatic Slug Detector
        Period: 01.2021-03.2021
        Role: Data Scientist
        Staffing: Team of 2
        Volume: 100\\%
        Description: >
            This project was part of Wintershall DEA's digitalization initiative. 
            I worked with the production optimization team in a use case dedicated to develop an automatic slug detection tool for the offshore production team in the Bragge oilfield.
            My role as a data scientist was to develop a backend solution that automatic detects anomalous events in Bragge's wells and categorizes them by severity.
            My backend solution was coupled with a dashboard solution in Grafana for easiness of visualization to the Bragge's team.	     
        Tools: Python, Cognite Data Fusion, git
    A2:
        Activity: Advanced Chalk Influx Advisor (scoping phase)
        Period: 10.2020-12.2020
        Role: Data Scientist
        Staffing: Team of 3
        Volume: 100\\%
        Description: >
            This project was part of AkerBP's digitalization program, Eureka, and its goal was to understand and ultimately predict chalk influx events in the Valhall oilfield. 
            My role as a data scientist in the scoping phase of the project was to help designing the foundations for the later development phase. 
            My broad role in the scoping phase lead me to: elaborate a root-cause diagram for chalk influx events, assess the use of proppant transport models as suitable for chalk transport, aid in the design of experimental work to characterize chalk influence on flow characteristics, data analysis of well tests, among others.
