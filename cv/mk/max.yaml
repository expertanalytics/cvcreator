Summary: >
    In essence, I am a problem-solver who relies on my extense scientific knowledge and experience in academia. 
    I have a PhD in Aerospace Engineering, from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE, 2014) and 
    before joining Expert Analytics I held two postdoctoral positions, one in Applied Mathematics, at the National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA, 2014-2016), 
    and one in Chemistry/Applied Mathematics, at the University of Bergen (UiB, 2016-2019). 
    My role in these projects was to develop mathematical models, and its associated numerical solvers, describing experimentally-obtained results. 
    Thus, I have an expertise in understanding real-world problems/data and translating them into a mathematical framework.
    
    I worked in close collaboration with researchers from different backgrounds (physicists, engineers, mathematicians, experimentalist chemists, etc) and 
    international institutions (Norway, Brazil, USA, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, UK). 
    Therefore, I have excellent communication skills and can easily connect with both technical and non-technical audiences.

            Analysis of the extinction limits of a diffusion flame established in porous media. 
            This collaborative work between INPE and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, was part of my PhD project. 
            This work identified the similarities between the extinction of a diffusion flame established in a porous matrix and the extinction of spread flames in solid fuels. 
            The novelty of this work was recognized by The Combustion Institute, who awarded it the prize of Distinguished Paper in the 36th International Symposium on Combustion.
