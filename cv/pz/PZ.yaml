Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: Audio Analytics for Predictive Maintenance in Hydropower
        Role: Lead Data Scientist
        Staffing: Team of 6 (extended team of 10)
        Description: In this R\&D project, we have tested the use of audio equipment as a non-invasive alternative for state-of-the-art vibration sensors. I have been leading the analytics team, which is in charge of developing and implementing deep learning and advanced machine learning models on edge as well as in the customer's cloud computing system. Furthermore, the high frequency audio data has been combined with operational data in a Python based machine learning platform, which is continuously monitoring the health status of the equipment. I have also been involved in the strategic planning and the implementation of the project on site and responsible for the interpretation and presentation of results to management and stakeholders.

    A2:
        Activity: Predictive Maintenance for Heavy Rotating Machinery in Hydropower
        Role: Senior Data Scientist
        Staffing: Team of 3
        Description: This project aims at prolonging the lifetime of hydropower generators and reducing their risk of failure as well as downtime due to maintenance actions. We are applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to heavy assets using Python for data processing, analysis and visualization. This includes data-driven model development applying time-series anomaly detection techniques and code development of cloud based products for running analytical models in production with notification services. I have been the main contact for the communication of technical results and concepts to non-technical stakeholders and managers.
        Tools: Python, GitLab, Azure, Docker
    A3:
        Activity: Taskforce Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning for Windpower
        Role: Senior Data Scientist
        Staffing: Team of 3
        Description: >
            The project goal was the development of a curtailment strategy for wind turbines based on data-driven prediction models. Based on sensor data from wind turbines, we identified prediction markers, which point to failure and established a life-time prediction model for wind turbine converters. In addition, a model was established for the optimal pro-active exchange of wind turbine converters given restrictions in the supply chain. All models are integrated in a scalable machine learning platform solution, which can be applied across fleet and easily adapted to other wind farms. 
        Tools: Python, Github, Docker, Jira

    A5:
        Activity: Anomaly detection in a plant production process at Aker BioMarine
        Role: Senior Data Scientist
        Staffing: Team of 2
        Description: >
            The goal of this project was to obtain a better understanding of the sensor data to enable the business side to take steps to avoid slowdowns in the production process.
            We created an asset hierarchy and data model for the production process by interpreting the available Human Machine Interface (HMI) screens from the factory.
            Data access is obtained through wrapper functions for queries to a GoogleCloud database. I ran time-series analyses of sensor data to monitor data quality, product flow, correlations, anomalies, etc. to get insights on the various processes in the production line, such as filling rates, predictive maintance and downtimes. All computations were performed using Python. The code is shared using GIT, enabling cooperation and versioning. Documentation in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

        Activity: Analysis of magnetohydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere
        Role: Project leader
        Staffing: Core team of 5, extended team of 10 collaborators
        Description: >
            This project on three-dimensional MHD models of the solar atmosphere aims at a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms, which lead to the high temperatures of the outer atmosphere of the Sun and other stars. I was leading the analysis part of the project, which includes carrying out numerical simulations on high-performance computing facilities, implementing new physics modules in the fortran code, as well as the analysis of synthetic spectra and their comparison with ground- and space-based solar observations. The results of this project have been published in peer-reviewed journals and were presented at international conferences.
