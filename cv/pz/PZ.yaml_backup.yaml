Summary: >
    I am a physicist with more than ten years of experience in scientific computing. I obtained a PhD in astrophysics on numerical simulations of the Sun in 2010. My areas of expertise include statistical data analysis, signal processing, and the development of various feature recognition algorithms and visualization tools for big data. My analytical mindset and a solid background in physics provide me with a good foundation for finding solutions to complex problems. I am an experienced project leader, thriving to continously develop my skills, while working either alone or in a team.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: Spectral analysis of magnetohydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere
        Role: Project leader
        Staffing: core team of 5, extended team of 10 collaborators
        Description: >
            This project on three-dimensional MHD models of the solar atmosphere aims at a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms, which lead to the high temperatures of the outer atmosphere of the Sun and other stars. I was leading the analysis part of the project, which includes carrying out numerical simulations on high-performance computing facilities and implementing new physics modules, as well as the analysis of synthetic spectra and their comparison with ground- and space-based solar observations.
#With a group of experts in the field, we are trying to find a good compromise between approximation, realism and computing time.
        Tools: numerical modeling, statistical data analysis, image analysis, scientific writing (documentation, scientific reports), python, fortran, git
    A2:
        Activity: Multi-wavelength analysis of magnetic bright points
        Role: Project leader
        Staffing: team of 4
        Description: >
           	This project aimed at studying the structure of magnetic bright points (MBPs), small-scale, magnetic elements in various layers of the solar atmosphere. The study is based on the analysis of high spatial- and temporal-resolution image-sequences from the Swedish Solar Telescope on La Palma. MBPs were identified and tracked in the time-series of images, and various physical properties of MBPs were determined by means of statistical data analysis.
        Tools: image analysis, feature recognition algorithms, python, scientific writing (documentation, scientific reports, master thesis), student supervision
    A3:
        Activity: Analysis of different wave-modes in MHD models

        Description: >
            In this study, we applied a wavelet power analysis to determine the frequency and power of various kind of waves that are present in the time-series of MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere. I developed unique analysis and visualization tools to investigated the power spectra of individual parcels of plasma, which has led to new insights on how and where energy is dissipated in various layers of the solar atmosphere.

        Description: >
            I was leading an international team of experts in a series of 3 one-weak workshops on the coronal mass cycle at the International Space Science Institute (ISSI), Bern, Switzerland. This two-year project included proposal writing, assembly of the team, invitation of speakers, organization of scientific programme, leadership of the workshop, and writing of publications.

        Description: >
             I was in charge of and member of several local and scientific organizing committees, such as the European Solar Physics Meeting, which is Europe's biggest solar physics community meeting with approximately 350 participants. I was responsible for organizing the programme, the planning of social activities, and providing information for participants. Between 2011 and 2014, I was supporting the organization of several workshops in the fields of Solar Physics, Earth Science and Cosmology. I was the scientific contact person for workshop attendees at the International Space Science Institute.

        Activity: AstronomyOnTap Oslo
        Role: Member of organizing committee
        Staffing: $\sim$8 members
        Description: >
            Together with my colleagues from the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, I am part of the initiative called Astronomy On Tap, which takes science to the public by giving talks at a pub in Oslo. The events are very popular and attract an audience of $\sim$100 on Monday nights.
