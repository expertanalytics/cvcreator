        \textbf{Ph.D.}
        Working with computational neuroscience at the University of Oslo.
        My work is focused on quantifying uncertainties in computational models of
        neurons and neural networks.
        Towards this end I have created a Python toolbox,
        found on my \href{https://github.com/simetenn/uncertainpy}{Github},
        tailored for performing these calculations in neuroscience.
        My Ph.D. work also includes learning new subjects,
        tools and techniques as necessary,
        as well as presenting my work in a wide variety of settings.

        \textbf{Master of Astronomy.}
        I specialized in numerical astrophysics and cosmology.
        I developed software ``from scratch'' in C++ that compares the results
        from large-scale N-body simulations of the universe with observational data.
        This problem is computationally intensive and the work included
        implementing advanced clustering algorithms,
        parallelization using MPI, and large-scale data analysis.

        \textbf{Teaching assistant at the University of Oslo}
        in a Python programming course - \href{http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF1100/}{Introduction to programming with scientific applications}.
        The work of a teaching assistant is to manage a class of students in
        their work with weekly compulsory programming projects.
        Additionally I corrected about 100 exercises from students every week.

       \textbf{Summer job at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo}.
        The first year I performed data reduction on a set of
        astronomical images and created software to automate the process (2011).
        The second year I implemented support for parallelization, using MPI,
        for what turned into the software I developed during my master (2012).
