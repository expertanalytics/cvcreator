Summary: >
    I am a computational phycisist and experienced software developer.
    From my background as computational phycisist I am equipped with excellent
    analytical skills and a solid foundation of numerical computing.


    In addition, I am also an easy to work with, pragmatic person and problem
    solver who is capabale of seeing the greater picture in things.
    Although I do have my personal preferences, I can quickly integrate into
    existing teams and choose the appropriate tools for the problem at hand.


    Throughout my career, I have worked with a broad variety of tools, ranging
    from embedded systems to cloud architectures. The last years, I have
    primarily worked with Python in rapidly developing environments which benefit
    from a dynamically typed language.
    However, I am more attracted by challenges which require the performance and
    control offered by statically typed languages such as C++ or Rust which I used
    mainly at university and some minor tooling in my recent projects.


#    #I enjoy taking new technologies into use, have demonstrated the benefits
    #of utlizing new tools in a variety of projects and believe that many
    #companies can greatly benefit from modernising their technology stacks.
    #Most recently, I am working with functional languages and features,
    #especially Rust and Haskell.

#    #In these projects I have built systems to process and analyze large amounts
    #of time-series data from industrial sensors and backend systems to process
    #satellite image data.

#    #building systems to process time-series data
#    #from industrial sensors and with backend systems to process large amounts
#    #of satellite image data.

#    #Therefore, I am looking to work together with companies interested in
#    #exploring ways to benefit from the use of new languages and paradigms.
#    #Especially projects where both speed, concurrency and safety are a concern.

#    My current mission is to contibute to the Norwegian technology landscape by
    #advocating the use of Rust (new technologies) and help companies
    #to profit from new developments in the computer science scene in general.


#I am available both as a consultant on-sight, trainer and speaker for
#    selected topics.


# Key points:
#   * algorithms/data structures
#   * Rust
#   * functional
#   * python
#   * satellite data
#   * time-series
#   * performance
#   * clean-code --> goes to personal skills
#   * agile/lean/etc. --> goes to personal skills

#
    #or where large amounts of data
    #need to be handeled.
#    The last years I have primarily worked with Python building systems to work
#    with time-series data from sensors and most recently with a backend system
#    to process large amounts of satellite images.
#
#
#
#    In the last year I was mainly programming in Python with a strong focus on
#    backend systems for the processing of time-series and satellite data.
#


#
# Notes: I added everything where I could point out a little bit experience.
# In concrete cases I would appreciate to narrow it down to the relevant things.
# e.g. Java, it's long ago I programmed in it, and it is not on my whishlist either

        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "5"
        Volume: "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            Part of the core developer team for Science [\&] Technology's
            satellite data processing backend. The backend system was built
            with python and all processing chains are abstracted as directed
            acyclic graphs. Each processing node was packed into docker images.
        Tools: "Python, Docker, Postgres, RESTful, TDD, git"
    A2:
        Activity: "Silvisense"
        Period: "08/2017 -- 12/2017"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "5"
        Volume: "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            Developed a processing chain to automatically detect land-cover
            changes with satellite images.
            The core of this work is a neural network to classify the land-cover
            type from satellite images. Changes are detected by analysing
            time-series of images.
            Besides the core algorithm a variety of tooling to facilitate in-
            and output of data had to be developed.
        Tools: "Python, C++, Keras, GDAL, shapely, hdf"
    A3:
        Activity: "Datana Prototype"
        Period: "1/2016 -- 12/2016"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "2"
        Volume: "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            Developed an internal prototype to handle the streaming of sensor
            data from offshore drilling units and their real-time analysis.
            The prototype was capable of handling both hot (streaming) data,
            and managing cold (archived) data with the same interface and user
            experience.
            A key feature I have designed was the possibility for engineers to
            submit their custom processing scripts to the backend system to make
            these results real-time available in the dashboard system targeted
            towards management.
        Tools: "Python, Go, Docker, MongoDB, InfluxDB, JWT, OAuth 2.0, Azure,
                Grafana, RESTful, Jupyter Notebook, git, TDD, agile"

        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "3"
        Volume: "100 \\%"
        Description: >
            Developed the data processing pipeline for 4Subsea's subsea
            monitoring system. The work involved designing of the workflow and
            architecture, interfacing the hardware, establishing communication
            to the subsea equipment, backend systems and the signal analysis
            itself.
            As part of this work I have migrated a large code basis from Matlab
            to Python and helped an engineering team to incorporate software
            development best practices into their workflow. For example source
            control, git workflow and code reviews.
        Tools: "Python, Jupyter Notebook, Git, Serial Protocols"
