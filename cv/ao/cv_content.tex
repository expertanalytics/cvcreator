\section*{Summary}

I am a senior software developer, project leader, and researcher, with 20 years of professional experience. Most of my career prior to founding Expert Analytics AS together with Ola Skavhaug, has been with Simula Research Laboratory, ranked as Norway's best ICT research institution in 2012. Through various positions in that company I have obtained a broad set of technical and management skills, which I since 2013 has used as Managing Director and Senior Consultant in Expert Analytics. My main areas of technical expertise spans from mathematical software development and scripting, to administration of advanced ICT solutions and configuration management. Both through education and practical hands-on experience I have developed strong analytical skills within my fields of expertise. \\ \\ As manager and leader of several projects with internal and external participants, I have learned the importance of understanding the strengths and skills of the participants in order to deliver on time. Communication within the team is always key to ensure that everyone have ownership in the project and stay motivated. This must always be balanced with a firm leadership.\\
