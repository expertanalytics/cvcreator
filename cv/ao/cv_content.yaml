      and from February 2016 until April 2017. My responsibilities in this project included integrations of third-party
      APIs for user-identification with Norwegian BankID, and development of APIs
      for access to mCASH resources for external integrators, based on OpenID Connect
      and Oauth protocols. I was also deeply involved in design and implementation
      of the transactional engine handling the payments; the core of the mCASH system.
      This engine connects persons, merchants and banks together, and computes transaction
      fees for involved parties in addition to moving correct amounts. I was lead developer for
      a new settlement system for merchants. The backend
      system of mCASH is implemented solely in Python. I have also been involved with other

      later at Simula Research Laboratory, I was in charge of building three different
      compute clusteres for advanced numerical computations. The systems grew from
      32 compute cores up to 576, and was configured with core os, multiple networks,
      schedulers and queue systems. The first clusters where managed with CFengine
      as provisioning system, while the last one was provisioned using Puppet.

  A2:
    Activity: Demographic and financial estimations
    Description: For customer we developed a web-based tool for statistical estimation
      of demographics within a large closed group, and a tool for economical planning
      of a large scale development. My main contribution was the mathematical analysis
      of the problem, and development of the necessary logic and algorithms. Further,
      I also implemented the system in a custom application server. The work was carried
      out in close collaboration with financial experts and a designer.

      a full technical infrastructure in the renovated office building at the old
      airport at Fornebu; office networks, back-end facilities and computer room,
      telephone systems, printers, servers, etc. Technical requirements, budgetary
      limitations and practical issues had to be taken into consideration in order
      to establish a scalable and flexible infrastructure.
    Role: Project leader and main architect
    Staffing: Project leader, 4 system administrators, external contractors
    Period: 01.2001 -- 12.2002

    Activity: Symphonical
    Description: Symphonical is a web-based collaboration tool. Initially it was conceived
      as a tool for running agile software development projects based on the metaphor
      of post-it notes on a virtual wall, a scope that since has been widened. We
      created the first prototype of the system, in 2005, before it was spun out as
      a company and developed further by others.
    Role: Main developer
    Staffing: Project leader and two developers
    Tools: PHP, MySql
  A5:
    Activity: Simulation of Medical Ultrasound
    Description: A research project where we studied different mathematical models
      for numerical simulation of medical ultrasound. My main responsibility was implementation
      of object oriented finite element based simulators for ultrasound propagating
      in inhomogeneous media. The target application was detection of tumors in tissue.
    Role: Researcher and main developer
    Staffing: 4--5 researchers and developers
    Tools: C++, Diffpack, MPI, VTK
  A6:
    Activity: PySE
    Description: Python Stencil Environment (PySE) is a high level environment for
      solving partial differential equations using finite difference methods (FDM).
      The environment provides an abstraction for the stencil concept of FDM, which
      makes it possible to implement FDM-based simulators in notation very close to
      the mathematical formulation. The environment is inherently parallell and distributes
      a problem on the available hardware in an optimal way based on the communication
      patterns defined by the stencils. PySE was developed as part of my PhD studies
      and published as open source software.
    Role: Main developer and researcher
    Tools: Python, Numpy, Scipy, SWIG, C++, MPI
  A7:
    Activity: Python Computing Components (PyCC)
    Description: PyCC is a modern and efficient scripting framework that is used to
      solve differential equations to study the electrical activity in the human heart.
      The main parts of PyCC is a high level scripting interface implemented in Python
      for flexibility and low-level extension modules implemented in C/C++ and Fortran
      for efficiency. My main role in the project was to provide a flexible build
      system for PyCC taking into account all the dependencies of the system. The
      build system was implemented using the SCons framework.
    Role: Developer
    Tools: C/C++, Fortran, Python, Swig, MPI, Subversion, SCons, PETSc, FEniCS, Hypre,
      BoomerAMG, Diffpack, GNU Compiler Collection and Debugger
  A8:
    Activity: Web site for Simula Research Laboratory
    Description: In order to facilitates new communication strategies for the company,
      it was necessary to update the web site for Simula Research Laboratory. New
      channels for communicating news and ongoing research projects were created,
      as well as a complete redesign of the company Intranet which at the same time
      replaced mailing list as the primary form of official internal communication.
      The process of upgrading the system consisted both of technical work and meetings
      with all the stakeholders within the organisation in order to develop a system
      in line with their needs.
    Role: Main developer and designer
    Tools: Python, PHP, Javascript, Plone, MySql
  A9:
    Activity: Outsourcing of ICT services
    Description: Simula Research Laboratory decided in 2012 to put a contract for
      its IT operations out for tender, after running the services with internal resources
      for a decade. My core responsibility was authoring the specification of the
      tender and evaluating the offers as well as participate in negotiating the final
      contract. I was also responsible for handling the communication with all the
      internal stakeholders. As the change affected the daily work of all employees
      it was particularly important to have an open and inclusive dialog in the process
      to ensure a satisfactory result.

Summary: I am a senior software developer, project leader, and researcher, with 20
  years of professional experience. Most of my career prior to founding Expert Analytics
  AS together with Ola Skavhaug, has been with Simula Research Laboratory, ranked
  as Norway's best ICT research institution in 2012. Through various positions in
  that company I have obtained a broad set of technical and management skills, which
  I since 2013 has used as Managing Director and Senior Consultant in Expert Analytics.
  My main areas of technical expertise spans from mathematical software development
  and scripting, to administration of advanced ICT solutions and configuration management.
  Both through education and practical hands-on experience I have developed strong
  analytical skills within my fields of expertise. \\ \\ As manager and leader of
  several projects with internal and external participants, I have learned the importance
  of understanding the strengths and skills of the participants in order to deliver
  on time. Communication within the team is always key to ensure that everyone have
  ownership in the project and stay motivated. This must always be balanced with a
  firm leadership.
