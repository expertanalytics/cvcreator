Summary: >
        I have recently defended my doctorate at the department of mathematics
        at the University of Oslo. My educational background is in probability
        theory and statistics with heavy focus on numerical programming and
        practical applications. In other words, I am what one could call a data
        scientist. My skills include programming in Python, which I have used
        to write a few software packages, anything and everything related to
        Bayesian probabilities, and doing error analysis on large scale
        numerical problems.

        - Geo-statistics
        - Uncertainty quantification
Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: Chaospy -- Uncertainty Quantification Toolbox
        Role: Researcher and algorithm developer
        Staffing: 1 researchers
        Description: >
            Chaospy is an open source toolbox containing a large collection of
            uncertainty quantification tools. It also include some
            state-of-the-art tools designed to reduce the computational budget
            in analysis. I wrote the software as part of my Ph.D. work. In
            collaboration with other researchers, I also help integrate Chaospy
            into other practical applications involving for example blood flow
            simulations.
        Tools: Python
    A2:
        Activity: Matlab to C++ converter
        Role: Software developer
        Staffing: 2 developers
        Description: >
            As part of an EU sponsored project, Simula Research Laboratory and
            Western Geco is collaborating to speed up the code translation step
            from Matlab to C++ using Armadillo. The approach insoles creating
            a full parser that creates semi-automatic translations.
            I contributed as the developer of the parser, and the structure of
            translation.
        Tools: Python, Armadillo, Sphinx
    A3:
        Activity: Information screen for Høyer
        Role: Backend developer
        Staffing: 2 developers
        Description: >
            Høyer is a clothing department store chain in Norway. The have
            multiple outlets across the country. Our job was to create
            information screen based on the daily and monthly sales and budget
            numbers. My contribution was to implement a web application that
            retrieved and processed data to be displayed.
        Tools: Python, Flask, Sqlite
    A4:
        Activity: Tsunami Warning System
        Role: Master student
        Staffing: 20 scientists
        Description: >
            As part of the threat of Tsunamis in Geiranger-fjorden,
            advanced detection system was implemented at Hellesylt to monitor
            movement of the land side.  My role was to develop an probabilistic
            learning algorithm to predict tsunami ahead of time.  To do this,
            I implemented a Bayesian network, a form of artificial
            intelligence, based on a combination of available data and expert
            elicitation.
