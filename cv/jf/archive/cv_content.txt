A0:
Activity: Chaospy -- uncertainty quantification toolbox \\
Role: Researcher and algorithm developer \\
Staffing: 1 researchers \\
Description: Chaospy is an open source toolbox containing a large collection of uncertainty quantification tools. It also include some state-of-the-art tools designed to reduce the computational budget in analysis. I wrote the software as part of my Ph.D. work. In collaboration with other researchers, I also help integrate Chaospy into other practical applications involving for example blood flow simulations. \\
Tools: Python \\

A1:
Activity: Matlab to C++ converter \\
Role: software developer \\
Staffing: 2 developers \\
Description: As part of an EU sponsored project, Simula Research Laboratory and Western Geco is collaborating to speed up the code translation step from Matlab to C++ using Armadillo. The approach involes creating a full parser that creates semi-automatic translations. I contributed as the developer of the parser, and the structure of translation. \\
Tools: Python, Armadillo, Sphinx
