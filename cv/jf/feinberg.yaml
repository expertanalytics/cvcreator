Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: Machine learning for Oncoimmunity
        Role: Consultant
        Staffing: 4 developers
        Description: >
            OncoImmunity develop bioinformatics software that has the
            ability to empower precision cancer immunotherapy, and thus
            improves the outlook for patients with late-stage disease. My role
            is to develop machine-learning methods applied to genomic data for
            tumor immune profiling. The goal is to select optimal patients to
            be assigned to cancer immunotherapy clinical trials.
        Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Keras
    A2:
        Activity: Machine learning for Statkraft
        Role: Consultant
        Staffing: 3 developers
        Description: >
            Statkraft is a leading company in hydropower internationally, and
            Europe's largest generator of renewable energy. Our role was to
            explore the possibility of applying machine learning to parts of
            Statkraft's core business. In particular, we looked into various
            machine learning techniques that could be used to predict future
            market energy consume. The techniques included applying methods
            like statistical regression, time-series models, and artificial
            neural networks.

            information screen based on the daily and monthly sales and budget
            numbers. My contribution was to implement a web application that
            retrieved and processed data to be displayed.
        Tools: Python, Flask, Sqlite
    A4:

        Role: Software developer
        Staffing: 2 developers
        Description: >
            As part of an EU sponsored project, Simula Research Laboratory and
            Western Geco is collaborating to speed up the code translation step
            from Matlab to C++ using Armadillo. The approach involves creating
            a full parser that creates semi-automatic translations.
            I contributed as the developer of the parser, and the structure of
            translation.
        Tools: Python, Armadillo, Sphinx
    A5:
        Activity: Chaospy -- Uncertainty Quantification Toolbox
        Role: Researcher and algorithm developer
        Staffing: 1 researchers
        Description: >
            Chaospy is an open source toolbox containing a large collection of
            uncertainty quantification tools. It also include some
            state-of-the-art tools designed to reduce the computational budget
            in analysis. I wrote the software as part of my Ph.D. work. In
            collaboration with other researchers, I also help integrate Chaospy
            into other practical applications involving for example blood flow
            simulations.
        Tools: Python
