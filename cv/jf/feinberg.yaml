Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: NEC Oncoimmunity
        Role: Senior Developer and Data Scientist
        Staffing: 20 Developers/Data Scientists/Bioinformaticians
        Description: >
            OncoImmunity develop bioinformatics software that has the
            ability to empower precision cancer immunotherapy, and thus
            improves the outlook for patients with late-stage disease. My role
            is to develop machine-learning methods applied to genomic data for
            tumor immune profiling. The goal is to select optimal patients to
            be assigned to cancer immunotherapy clinical trials.
        Tools: Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
    A2:
        Activity: Statkraft
        Role: Data Scientist
        Staffing: 3 developers
        Description: >
            Statkraft is a leading company in hydropower internationally, and
            Europe's largest generator of renewable energy. Our role was to
            explore the possibility of applying machine learning to parts of
            Statkraft's core business. In particular, we looked into various
            machine learning techniques that could be used to predict future
            market energy consume. The techniques included applying methods
            like statistical regression, time-series models, and artificial
            neural networks.
        Tools: Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
    A3:
        Activity: Matlab to C++ converter
        Role: Software developer
        Staffing: 2 developers
        Description: >
            As part of an EU sponsored project, Simula Research Laboratory and
            WesternGeco is collaborating to speed up the code translation step
            from Matlab to C++ using Armadillo. The approach involves creating
            a full parser that creates semi-automatic translations.
            I contributed as the developer of the parser, and the structure of
            translation.

    A4:
        Activity: Chaospy -- Uncertainty Quantification Toolbox
        Role: Software Maintainer
        Staffing: 2 developers
        Description: >
            Chaospy is an actively maintained open source toolbox containing
            a large collection of uncertainty quantification tools. It also
            includes some state-of-the-art tools designed to reduce the
            computational budget in analysis. Chaospy is currently used as
            numerical engine in multiple research and development projects.

    A5:
        Activity: Numpoly -- Multivariate polynomials as NumPy datatype
        Role: Software Maintainer
        Staffing: 1 developer
        Description: >
            Numpoly is an open source library for creating, manipulating
            polynomial arrays. The library provides a subclass of
            \verb;numpy.ndarray; implemented to represent polynomials as array
            element. As such it is fast and scales very well with the size of
            the coefficients, in addition to it being compatible with most
            \verb;numpy; functionalities.
