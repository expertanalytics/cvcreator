            OncoImmunity develop bioinformatics software that has the ability
            to empower precision cancer immunotherapy, improving the outlook
            for patients with late-stage disease. My role there was to develop
            machine-learning methods applied to genomic data for tumor immune
            profiling. The goal is to select optimal patients to be assigned to
            cancer immunotherapy clinical trials.

            to explore the possibility of applying machine learning to parts of
            Statkraft's core business. In particular, we looked into various
            machine learning techniques that could be used to predict future
            market energy consume. The techniques included applying methods
            like statistical regression, time-series models, and artificial
            neural networks.

        Description: >
            Numpoly is an open source library for creating, manipulating
            polynomial arrays. The library provides a subclass of
            \verb;numpy.ndarray; implemented to represent polynomials as array
            element. As such it is fast and scales very well with the size of
            the coefficients, in addition to it being compatible with most
            \verb;numpy; functionalities.
