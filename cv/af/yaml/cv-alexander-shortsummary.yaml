Summary: >
    I submitted my master thesis in computational physics in the beginning of
    2018. The objective of the thesis was building a C++ application for simulating 
    quantum dots. 
    My goal was to develop code that was up to par with industry standards and
    my focus was on writing good, readable code with extensive unit-testing. 
    In addition to C++ I used Python for data analysis during my thesis.
    As a developer, I've cultivated my Python skills, and I now have eight years
    of experience with Python. 
    I am currently working on a project at the transit company Ruter.

SelectedSkills:
    Programming: >
        During my education, practically every subject involved some
        form of programming and I also enjoy recreational programming and scripting.
        I have eight years of Python programming experience and about five years
        of experience with Git.
    Quick learner: >
        I like to learn, and do so quickly, in particular about programming and science.
    Problem solving: >
        Both my current project, previous work experience and my master thesis has taught me to 
        work independently and assess the task at hand.
    Written communication: >
        I like writing clear and concise texts. 
        Everything from popular science to documenting code.

        Description: >
            The "Stop Poster Production System" is Ruter's system for 
            automated generation of timetable posters for the 8000 bus stops 
            in Oslo and Akershus.
            I further developed the backend logic and expanded the system to a
            self-service website for easily generating and
            distributing large quantities of stop posters at a time.
            The website was developed with the Python micro-framework
            and hosted using Apache.
            I also implemented the Travelling Salesman Problem for
            finding the quickest route between a set of bus stops for more
            efficient deployment of stop posters.
            In addition to development, I planned and ordered the change
            of stop posters during the bianually route updates.

    A2:
        Activity: "Monte Carlo Studies of Quantum Dots"
        Staffing: "2 researchers"
        Description: >
            For my master thesis, I developed software for finding the ground 
            state energies of quantum dots (fermions) using the variational Monte-Carlo method.
            The program handles different potential wells like the single and double
            harmonic oscillator and the finite square well.
            Furthermore I solved the Schrödinger equation of the potential systems to obtain
            one-particle wavefunctions of the energy states.
            The resulting wavefunction was then written as a linear combination 
            of simple harmonic oscillator basisfunctions which were used in the 
            Monte-Carlo solver and compared against the results of the original Monte-Carlo simulations.
            The code was primarily C++ with some data analysis in Python.
            I put effort and focus on unit testing and writing clean code.
