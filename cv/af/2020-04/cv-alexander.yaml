Summary: >
    In 2018, I received my master's thesis in computational physics. 
    The objective of the thesis was building a C++ application for 
    simulating quantum dots. 
    My goal was to develop code that was up to par with industry standards and
    I focused on writing good, readable code with extensive testing. 
    In addition to C++ I used Python for data analysis.
    As a developer, I've cultivated my Python skills, 
    and I now have ten years of experience with Python. 
    Since February 2018, I have been working on a project at the transit
    administration company Ruter.

SelectedSkills:
    Programming: >
        During my education, practically every subject involved some
        form of programming and I also enjoy recreational programming 
        and scripting.
    Quick learner: >
        I like to learn, and do so quickly, in particular about programming 
        and science.
    Problem solving: >
        Both my current project, previous work experience and my master 
        thesis has taught me to work independently and assess the task at hand.
    Written communication: >
        I like writing clear and concise texts. 
        Everything from popular science to documenting code.

        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "1 developer"
        Period: "February 2018—March 2020"
        Description: >
            Worked as a fullstack developer developing a backend system
            for automatic generation of production files (PDFs) for analogue
            transit stop information, and a web app for the users.
            In addition, I implemented a tool for generating optimal 
            routes between stops, as well as other tools for the project.
        Tools: >
            Python, Javascript, Flask, PostgreSQL, Apache, Google OR-Tools,
            Google Maps API, Entur API
    A2:
        Activity: "Project at Ruter As"
        Role: "Developer/adviser"
        Staffing: "3 developers, 1 team lead, 1 UX/UI designer"
        Period: "February 2018—March 2020"
        Description: >
            We developed a content management system in form of a web app
            for Ruter.
            In addition to some development (Node/React), 
            I advised the team on the direction of the project,
            performed daily code review and contributed to sprint 
            retrospects and planning.
        Tools: "Javascript/Node, React, PostgreSQL, AWS, Jenkins, Python"
    A4:
        Activity: "Monte Carlo Studies of Quantum Dots"
        Staffing: "2 researchers"
        Description: >
            For my master thesis, I developed software for finding the ground 
            state energies of quantum dots (fermions) using the variational 
            Monte-Carlo method. The program handles different potential wells, 
            like the single and double
            harmonic oscillator and the finite square well.
            Furthermore I solved the Schrödinger equation of the potential 
            systems to obtain one-particle wavefunctions of the energy states.
            The resulting wavefunction was then written as a linear combination 
            of simple harmonic oscillator basisfunctions which were used in the 
            Monte-Carlo solver and compared against the results of the original 
            Monte-Carlo simulations.
            The code was primarily C++ with some data analysis in Python.
            I put effort and focus on unit testing and writing clean code.
        Tools: "C++, Python, Armadillo, MPI, Numpy"
