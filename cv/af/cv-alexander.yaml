Summary: >
    I received my master's thesis in computational physics in 2018. 
    The objective of the thesis was building a C++ and Python application for 
    simulating quantum dots.
    As a programmer, I focus on writing clean, 
    readable code with extensive testing. 
    These are ideas I always try to bring into the projects I work on.
    From February 2018 to March 2020, I worked on two projects at the transit
    administration company Ruter.
    During both my studies and work career, I've always cultivated my 
    programming skills. 
    This has resulted in ten years of experience programming in Python.

SelectedSkills:
    Programming: >
        I enjoy coding on and off the clock, and I am always interested in
        becoming a better programmer.
    Quick learner: >
        I like to learn, and do so quickly. In particular about programming 
        and science.
    Problem solving: >
        The projects I've worked on as a consultant, 
        previous work experience and my master 
        thesis have all taught me to work independently 
        and assess the task at hand.
    Written communication: >
        I like writing clear and concise texts.
        This ranges from popular science to documenting code.

Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: "Project at Ruter As"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "1 developer"
        Period: "February 2018—August 2020"
        Description: >
            I worked as a full-stack developer developing a Python backend
            and web app for an internal tool at Ruter.
            The tool is used to automatically generate production files
            (PDFs) that display relevant travel information for a 
            given stop place, based on its metadata.
            This comprises timetables, maps, ticket information and so
            forth. The web app then lets a user easily generate such files
            for a set of stop places, which in turn can be printed and
            displayed physically on the stop place.
            In addition, I implemented a tool for generating optimal 
            routes between stops using Google OR-Tools,
            as well as other scripts for the project.
        Tools: >
            Python, Flask, Javascript, PostgreSQL, Apache, Entur API, 
            SQLAlchemy, PyPDF4, ReportLab, Alembic, Google OR-Tools,
            Google Maps API
    A2:
        Activity: "Project at Ruter As"
        Role: "Developer/adviser"
        Staffing: "3 developers, 1 team lead, 1 UX/UI designer"
        Period: "February 2018—March 2020"
        Description: >
            We developed a content management system in the form of a web app
            for Ruter. In addition to some development (Node/React), 
            I advised the team on the direction of the project,
            performed daily code review and contributed to sprint 
            retrospects and planning.
        Tools: "Javascript/Node, React, PostgreSQL, AWS, Jenkins, Python"
    A3:
        Activity: "Slack bot"
        Staffing: "1 developer"
        Description: >
            I developed a slack bot for internal scheduling of social events.
            The backend is a fully functional REST API built 
            with FastAPI in Python.
            Both the API and the PostgreSQL database are hosted on Heroku,
            using CircleCI for continuous deployment.
        Tools: >
            Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Slack API, 
            Heroku, CircleCI, pytest, Alembic
    A4:
        Activity: "Monte Carlo Studies of Quantum Dots"
        Staffing: "2 researchers/developers"
        Description: >
            For my master thesis, I developed software for simulating the 
            ground-states of quantum dots (``fermions'') 
            using the variational Monte-Carlo method. 
            The simulations were written in C++ while data analysis
            and visualizations were done in Python.
            I put a lot of effort and focus on unit testing 
            and writing clean code.
        Tools: "C++, Python, Armadillo, MPI, NumPy, Matplotlib"
