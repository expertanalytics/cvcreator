Summary: |
    I have a masters degree in Computational Science from the University of Oslo, completed in
    2016. My project was about a particle system modeling linear elasticity, and accelerating
    linear algebra computations using GPUs. From my studies leading to this degree I have gained
    broad knowledge about algorithms, numerical mathematics, and programming in several languages.

    Work experience prior to Expert Analytics includes mostly one-to-one teaching in a lab
    setting, but also as lecturing and live coding in plenary settings. I have also worked with
    testing{---}both manual and automated, and with Android development and some minor Javascript
    development.

        Description: |
            I worked in a team with designing and implementing a domain and asset model to be used
            in a project developing a cloud solution for petrochemical plants.

            I joined in the design and prototype phase of creating the model, and continued into
            developing the implementation to be used with the rest of the project. I worked on
            the overall model design in collaboration with the rest of the team, and on the data
            structure components of the model, and on parsing, analysing, and cleaning existing
            Json data before importing.
        Tools: Python, TypeScript, Git, JIRA, and Confluence
    A2:
        Activity: "Prototype IoT platform at Statkraft"
        Period: "July 2019 --- Nov. 2019"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "3 developers"
        Volume: "20\\%"
        Description: |
            At Statkraft they need to monitor and collect diverse sensor data. To look into
            building their own IoT platform they are hosting a project to set up a prototype
            platform, and develop sensor nodes to collect operational data from a wind park.

            My role in the project is to design and build the sensor node, to implement
            communication between the node and the gateway using LoRaWAN, and interface the node
            with the sensor circuitry being developed in parallel.
        Tools: ESP32, Arduino, ESP-IDF, and C/C++
    A3:
        Activity: "Data collection, modelling, and analysis at Statkraft"
        Period: "Aug.\ 2017 --- Dec.\ 2019"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "3 developers, 2 hydrologists"
        Volume: "100\\% until June 2019, 80\\% from July 2019, 60\\% from November 2019"
        Description: |
            Statkraft is a major hydropower producer in Norway, and have need of stable and correct
            data. As part of updating their data frameworks they are hosting several projects for
            improving data collection and storage, and redesigning models and access layers.

            My role has been to develop interfaces and collection utilities for unstable data
            sources, design and implement a model of the network of sensor stations and nodes,
            and data analysis of hydrological/meterologial time series data.

        Activity: The norwegian land register (NO:~{\it{}{``}Matrikkelen{''}}) at Kartverket
        Period: "Apr.\ 2017 --- May 2017"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "More than 10 developers"
        Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: |
            Kartverket develops and maintains the land register software systems. The system has
            to be performant for changes, and to keep a full history of every change to the data.

            I have redesigned and implemented the algorithms for computing changes to land borders
            using a specialized depth-first graph search.
        Tools: Java, Oracle SQL, Hibernate, IntelliJ IDEA, JIRA, Confluence, and Perforce
    A5:
        Activity: Region and Municipality reorganization (NO:~{\it{}{``}Kommunereformen{''}})
            at Kartverket
        Period: "Jan.\ 2017 --- Apr.\ 2017"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "5 developers"
        Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: |
            Kartverket develops and maintains the land register software systems. As part of the
            norwegian region and municipality reoragnization, the land register needs to perform
            huge number of changes in as short a time as possible. As such they need to implement
            specialized algorithms to be able to process the data in the available time frame.

            My part of the project has been to develop algorithms to automatically partition land
            data into sets of independent structures to enable parallel processing without
            dead-locking the database. Data dependence was defined by both logical and algorithmic
            constraints of the data transforms, and by database constraints. The partitioning was
            done using graph search and graph partitioning algorithms.
        Tools: Java, Oracle SQL, Hibernate, IntelliJ IDEA, JIRA, Confluence, and Perforce
    A6:
        Activity: "A C++/OpenCL library for sparse linear algebra"
        Period: "Aug.\ 2015 --- Dec.\ 2017"
        Role: "Researcher and developer"
        Staffing: "1 researcher"
        Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: |
            Developed as part of my masters degree at the University of Oslo.
            The library implements several different sparse matrix schemes and matrix-vector
            operations. Matrix-vector algorithms are implemented both serially, and parallel for
            GPUs using the OpenCL framework.
        Tools: C++, OpenCL, Python, CMake, and Git
    A7:
        Activity: "Prototype an Android app for logging mobile network parameters"
        Period: "June 2013 --- Aug.\ 2014"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "1 developer"
        Volume: "June/July 2013 and 2014: 100\\%. Otherwise: 20\\%"
        Description: |
            The project was to determine if an Android device coupled with proprietary data from
            the network operator could access enough parameters from the mobile network as to be
            usefull for logging network state and diagnosing network problems.
            To access enough parameters hidden Android APIs was accessed through reflection in
            addition to the public APIs available through the Android SDK.
            As the app used proprietary network data it was never meant for public use and is not
            available.
        Tools: Android, Java, IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, and Git
