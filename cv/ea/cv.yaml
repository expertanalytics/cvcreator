Summary: |
    I have a masters degree in Computational Science from the University of Oslo, completed in
    2016. My project was about a particle system modeling linear elasticity, and accelerating
    linear algebra computations using GPUs. From my studies leading to this degree I have gained
    broad knowledge about algorithms, numerical mathematics, and programming in several languages.

    Prior work experience includes teaching programming: mostly one-to-one teaching in a lab
    setting, but also as lecturing and live coding in plenary settings. I have also worked with
    testing{---}both manual and automated, and with Android development and some minor Javascript
    development.

        Summer intern at Teleplan Globe AS.

        Worked on testing web applications: both manually and by automating manual procedures.
Projects:
    A1:
        Activity: The norwegian land register (NO:~{\it{}{``}Matrikkelen{''}})
        Period: "April.\ 2017 ---"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "More than 10 developers"
        Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: |
            I redesigned and implemented the algorithms for computing land borders using
            a specialized depth-first graph search. 
        Tools: Java, Oracle SQL, Hibernate, IntelliJ IDEA, JIRA, Confluence and Perforce
    A2:
        Activity: Region and Municipality reorganization (NO:~{\it{}{``}Kommunereformen{''}})
        Period: "Jan.\ 2017 --- April.\ 2017"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "5 developers"
        Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: |
            My part of the project was to partition land data into sets of independent data
            to enable parallel processing without dead-locking the database.
            Data dependence was defined by both logical and algorithmic constraints of the data
            transforms, and by database indices and constraints.
            The partitioning was done using graph partitioning algorithms.
        Tools: Java, Oracle SQL, Hibernate, IntelliJ IDEA, JIRA, Confluence and Perforce
    A3:
        Activity: "A C++/OpenCL library for sparse linear algebra"
        Period: "Aug.\ 2015 --- Dec. 2017"
        Role: "Researcher and developer"
        Staffing: "1 researcher"
        Volume: "100\\%"
        Description: |
            Developed as part of my masters degree at the University of Oslo.
            The library implements several different sparse matrix schemes and matrix-vector
            operations. Matrix-vector algorithms are implemented both serially, and parallel for
            GPUs using the OpenCL framework.
        Tools: C++, OpenCL, Python, CMake, and Git
    A4:
        Activity: "Prototype an Android app for logging mobile network parameters"
        Period: "June 2013 --- Aug.\ 2014"
        Role: "Developer"
        Staffing: "1 developer"
        Volume: "June/july 2013 and 2014: 100\\%. Otherwise: 20\\%"
        Description: |
            The project was to determine if an Android device coupled with proprietary data from
            the network operator could access enough parameters from the mobile network as to be
            usefull for logging network state and diagnosing network problems.
            To access enough parameters hidden Android APIs was accessed through reflection in
            addition to the public APIs available through the Android SDK.
            As the app used proprietary network data it was never meant for public use and is not
            available.
        Tools: Android, Java, IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, and Git
